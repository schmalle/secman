# Feature Specification: Enhanced MCP Tools for Security Data Access

**Feature Branch**: `009-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i want to access all stored asset information via MCP. I want to access also all open ports, all vulnerabilities via MCP."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: How should MCP tools authenticate and verify user identity when accessing security data? ‚Üí A: Use dedicated MCP API keys with permission scopes
- Q: What rate limits should apply to MCP query operations to prevent abuse and ensure system stability? ‚Üí A: More permissive (5000 req/min, 100K req/hour) for automation
- Q: Should MCP tools return real-time data directly from the database, or is caching acceptable? ‚Üí A: Always real-time (query database directly)
- Q: What pagination limits should apply to MCP queries to balance performance and usability? ‚Üí A: Large (max 1000 items/page, 100K total results)
- Q: When an MCP query includes filters that would return assets/vulnerabilities the user doesn't have access to (due to workgroup restrictions), what should happen? ‚Üí A: Return error indicating insufficient permissions

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An AI assistant or automation tool needs to programmatically access comprehensive security data from the secman system, including all asset details, network port information from scans, and vulnerability records. The tool should be able to query this data through standardized interfaces without needing direct database access or custom integration code.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an AI assistant is analyzing security posture, **When** it queries for all assets with their complete information, **Then** it receives a complete list of assets including metadata, ownership, network details, workgroup assignments, and creation/update timestamps
2. **Given** a security analyst tool needs port information, **When** it queries for open ports across assets, **Then** it receives all scan results showing discovered ports, services, products, and versions for each asset
3. **Given** a vulnerability tracking system needs current exposure data, **When** it queries for vulnerabilities, **Then** it receives all vulnerability records with CVE IDs, CVSS severity, affected assets, days open, and scan timestamps
4. **Given** an AI assistant needs comprehensive asset context, **When** it queries for a specific asset's complete profile, **Then** it receives the asset details, all associated vulnerabilities, complete scan history, and all discovered ports/services
5. **Given** a compliance reporting tool needs to filter data, **When** it queries with specific filters (asset type, severity, IP range, owner), **Then** it receives only matching records respecting access control rules

### Edge Cases
- When querying for assets/vulnerabilities that the requesting user doesn't have access to (workgroup-based access control), the system returns an error indicating insufficient permissions
- How does the system handle queries for assets with no scan results or vulnerabilities? (Returns empty arrays/lists for those fields)
- What happens when pagination limits are exceeded? (Returns error indicating limit exceeded)
- How are deleted or historical records handled? (Only current/active records are returned)
- What happens when querying for open ports on assets that have never been scanned? (Returns empty scan results list)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide access to complete asset inventory including all stored attributes (name, type, IP, owner, description, groups, cloud metadata, AD domain, OS version, workgroup assignments, creation/modification timestamps, creator/uploader information)
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide access to all open port information discovered through network scans, including port number, service name, product name, product version, and discovery timestamp
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide access to all vulnerability records including CVE identifiers, CVSS severity ratings, vulnerable product versions, days open count, associated asset references, and scan timestamps
- **FR-004**: System MUST support filtering and pagination for all data queries with a maximum of 1000 items per page and 100,000 total results per query to handle large datasets efficiently
- **FR-005**: System MUST respect existing workgroup-based access control rules and return an error with insufficient permissions message when a query attempts to access assets or vulnerabilities outside the user's workgroups or ownership scope
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide comprehensive asset profile queries that combine asset details, associated vulnerabilities, scan history, and discovered ports/services in a single response
- **FR-007**: System MUST support filtering assets by type, name, IP address, owner, workgroup, and other metadata fields
- **FR-008**: System MUST support filtering vulnerabilities by CVE ID, severity level, associated asset, date range, and exception status
- **FR-009**: System MUST support filtering scan results by scan type, upload date, uploader, and associated asset
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle queries for assets with no associated scan results or vulnerabilities without errors
- **FR-011**: System MUST authenticate MCP tool access using dedicated API keys with configurable permission scopes that map to user roles and workgroup memberships
- **FR-012**: System MUST enforce rate limits of 5000 requests per minute and 100,000 requests per hour per API key to support high-volume automation while preventing abuse
- **FR-013**: System MUST return real-time data by querying the database directly for all MCP tool requests, ensuring users always receive current asset, vulnerability, and scan information

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Asset**: Complete security asset record including network identity (name, IP), classification (type, owner), metadata (groups, cloud IDs, AD domain, OS version), relationships (workgroups, creator/uploader), and temporal data (last seen, creation/update timestamps)
- **ScanResult**: Network port discovery record representing an open port found during scanning, including service identification (port, service name, product, version) and discovery timestamp, linked to parent asset
- **Vulnerability**: Security vulnerability record linking a CVE identifier to an affected asset, including severity assessment (CVSS rating), temporal tracking (days open, scan timestamp), and product version information
- **Workgroup**: Access control group that defines which users can see which assets, enforcing data isolation boundaries
- **VulnerabilityException**: Exception rule that can exclude certain vulnerabilities from reporting based on IP address or product, with expiration tracking
