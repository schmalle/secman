# Specification Quality Checklist: Account Vulns - AWS Account-Based Vulnerability Overview

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: PASSED (All items complete)

**Assumptions Made**:
1. Workgroup-based access control (Feature 008) applies in combination with AWS account filtering - users must have both workgroup permission AND AWS account mapping to see an asset
2. Default sort order: vulnerability count descending (highest risk first)
3. Assets without cloudAccountId are intentionally excluded (null is treated as "not in an AWS account")
4. Multiple AWS accounts displayed on single page (no pagination between accounts) - pagination may be added per account group for large asset lists
5. Admin role check takes precedence over all other logic (admins always see the redirect message)
6. Navigation from Account Vulns to asset detail preserves context for "Back" navigation
7. Vulnerability counts are real-time at page load (no caching or stale data)

**Clarifications NOT Needed** (reasonable defaults applied):
- UI grouping mechanism (left unspecified - implementation can choose accordion, tabs, or separate sections)
- Pagination threshold for large asset lists (assumed standard pattern will be applied during implementation)
- Specific error message styling (standard error UI patterns apply)
- Performance optimization techniques (left to implementation, success criteria defines performance expectations)

**Next Steps**:
- Specification ready for `/speckit.clarify` (if interactive refinement desired) or `/speckit.plan` (to begin implementation planning)
