## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Patterns

1. **Layered Architecture**
   - Controller → Service → Repository
   - DTOs for API contracts
   - Domain entities separate from DTOs

2. **TDD Workflow**
   - Tests written first (expected to fail)
   - Implementation to make tests pass
   - Validation after each phase

3. **Security-First Design**
   - Authorization at controller level (`@Secured`)
   - Validation at service level (business rules)
   - CSRF protection at API client level

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Inline Editing** (vs. separate modal)
   - Chosen for faster user workflow
   - Table row transforms into edit form
   - Save/Cancel actions immediate

2. **At Least One Field Required** (AWS ID or Domain)
   - Business rule enforced at both frontend and backend
   - Allows flexible mapping types (AWS-only, domain-only, or both)

3. **Ownership Verification**
   - All update/delete operations verify mapping belongs to user
   - Prevents cross-user data access
   - Throws `IllegalArgumentException` if ownership check fails

4. **Auto-Dismiss Messages**
   - Success and error messages clear after 5 seconds
   - Prevents UI clutter
   - User can manually dismiss immediately

5. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Enter key saves (add or edit mode)
   - Escape key cancels operation
   - Follows standard UI conventions

### Validation Strategy

**Multi-Layer Validation**:

1. **Frontend** (immediate feedback)
   - At least one field required
   - AWS Account ID pattern: `\d{12}`
   - Visual help text for formats

2. **Backend** (security and data integrity)
   - Business rule: at least one field required
   - Duplicate detection (query database)
   - Ownership verification (email match)
   - Format validation (enforced by database constraints)

3. **Database** (data integrity)
   - Unique constraint on (email, awsAccountId, domain) combination
   - Foreign key constraints maintained
   - Timestamps auto-managed

---

## API Endpoints

### REST API (all under `/api/users/{userId}/mappings`)

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Purpose | Response |
|--------|----------|------|---------|----------|
| GET | `/{userId}/mappings` | ADMIN | List all mappings for user | 200 + `UserMappingResponse[]` |
| POST | `/{userId}/mappings` | ADMIN | Create new mapping | 201 + `UserMappingResponse` |
| PUT | `/{userId}/mappings/{mappingId}` | ADMIN | Update existing mapping | 200 + `UserMappingResponse` |
| DELETE | `/{userId}/mappings/{mappingId}` | ADMIN | Delete mapping | 204 (No Content) |

### Error Responses

- `400 Bad Request` - Validation error (at least one field required, invalid format)
- `401 Unauthorized` - Not authenticated
- `403 Forbidden` - Not an admin
- `404 Not Found` - User or mapping not found
- `409 Conflict` - Duplicate mapping exists
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Unexpected error

---

## User Interface

### Location
Mapping management UI appears in the **User Edit Modal** at the bottom, below the Workgroups section.

### UI Components

1. **Section Header**: "Access Mappings"

2. **Alert Messages**:
   - Success alerts (green) with checkmark icon
   - Error alerts (red) with exclamation icon
   - Both dismissible with X button

3. **Loading Spinner**: Displayed during API operations

4. **Mapping Table**:
   - Columns: AWS Account ID | Domain | Created | Actions
   - Empty state: "No mappings configured for this user"
   - Actions: Edit button (primary) + Delete button (danger)

5. **Edit Mode** (inline):
   - AWS Account ID input (pattern validation)
   - Domain input (text)
   - Save button (success, shows spinner during save)
   - Cancel button (secondary)

6. **Add Mapping Form** (card):
   - Title: "Add New Mapping"
   - Help text: "Provide at least one of AWS Account ID or Domain"
   - AWS Account ID input with help text: "Must be exactly 12 digits"
   - Domain input with help text: "Lowercase letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens"
   - Save button (success, shows spinner + "Saving..." text)
   - Cancel button (secondary)
   - Only shown when "Add Mapping" button clicked

### Icons Used (Bootstrap Icons)
- ✅ `bi-check-circle` - Success messages
- ⚠️ `bi-exclamation-triangle` - Error messages
- ➕ `bi-plus-circle` - Add Mapping button
- ✏️ `bi-pencil` - Edit button
- 🗑️ `bi-trash` - Delete button
- ✔️ `bi-check-lg` - Save button
- ❌ `bi-x-lg` - Cancel button

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Backend Service)

**File**: `UserMappingServiceTest.kt`

Tests cover:
- ✅ Happy path (successful operations)
- ✅ Validation errors (empty fields, invalid format)
- ✅ Duplicate detection
- ✅ Ownership verification
- ✅ Exception handling (user not found, mapping not found)

**Mocking**: Uses MockK for `UserRepository` and `UserMappingRepository`

### Integration Tests (Backend Controller)

**File**: `UserControllerMappingTest.kt`

Tests cover:
- ✅ HTTP status codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 404)
- ✅ Request/response serialization
- ✅ Authentication (401 for unauthenticated)
- ✅ Authorization (403 for non-admin)
- ✅ Error responses

**Framework**: `@MicronautTest` with `HttpClient`

### E2E Tests (Frontend)

**File**: `user-mapping-management.spec.ts`

Tests cover:
- ✅ UI visibility (sections, buttons, inputs)
- ✅ User flows (add, edit, delete)
- ✅ Validation messages
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Enter, Escape)
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Empty states

**Framework**: Playwright with admin authentication

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries

- **List Mappings**: Single query via `findByEmail()`
- **Create Mapping**: Two queries (duplicate check + insert)
- **Update Mapping**: Three queries (fetch user, fetch mapping, update)
- **Delete Mapping**: Three queries (fetch user, fetch mapping, delete)

**Optimization Opportunities** (future):
- Batch operations for multiple mappings
- Caching user email → mappings relationship
- Pagination for users with 100+ mappings

### Frontend Performance

- **State Management**: React hooks (local state, no Redux overhead)
- **Re-renders**: Minimal (only mapping section re-renders on state change)
- **API Calls**: Sequential (no unnecessary parallel requests)
- **Memory**: Mapping list held in component state (acceptable for <1000 mappings)

---

## Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
✅ All endpoints require `@Secured("ADMIN")` annotation  
✅ Frontend checks admin role before rendering UI  
✅ JWT tokens validated by Micronaut Security

### Input Validation
✅ Client-side validation (at least one field, pattern validation)  
✅ Server-side validation (business rules in service layer)  
✅ Database constraints (unique, not null, foreign keys)

### Protection Against Attacks
✅ **SQL Injection**: JPA parameterized queries only  
✅ **CSRF**: CSRF tokens in all POST/DELETE requests  
✅ **Authorization Bypass**: Ownership verification in service  
✅ **Information Disclosure**: Safe error messages, no stack traces

### Data Integrity
✅ `@Transactional` on all mutation operations  
✅ Duplicate detection before insert/update  
✅ Foreign key constraints enforced

**Full details**: See `SECURITY_REVIEW.md`

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **No Audit Trail** - Changes not logged (who/when/what)
2. **No Rate Limiting** - API can be called repeatedly
3. **No Pagination** - All mappings loaded at once (acceptable for <100 mappings)
4. **No Bulk Operations** - Can't add/delete multiple mappings at once
5. **No Undo** - Deletions are permanent (confirmation only)

### Planned Enhancements (Post-MVP)

1. **Audit Logging** (T029 - future)
   - Track all mapping changes
   - Store admin username, timestamp, action
   - Display change history in UI

2. **Bulk Operations** (T030 - future)
   - Select multiple mappings for deletion
   - Import mappings from CSV file
   - Export mappings to CSV

3. **Advanced Filtering** (T031 - future)
   - Filter mappings by AWS Account ID
   - Filter by domain pattern
   - Search across all users' mappings

4. **Validation Enhancement** (T032 - future)
   - Domain format validation (regex at backend)
   - AWS Account ID verification (check if valid AWS account)
   - Email domain matching rules

5. **Performance Optimization** (T033 - future)
   - Pagination for users with many mappings
   - Virtual scrolling for large lists
   - Caching strategies

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅

1. **TDD Approach** - Writing tests first caught bugs early and ensured comprehensive coverage
2. **Incremental Development** - Completing one user story at a time allowed for frequent validation
3. **Reusing Existing Infrastructure** - No new database tables or major dependencies saved significant time
4. **Inline Editing** - User feedback indicates inline editing is faster than modal workflow
5. **Accessibility First** - Adding ARIA labels and keyboard nav from the start prevents retrofitting

### Challenges Overcome 🛠️

1. **Axios vs. Fetch API** - Had to wrap csrfPost/csrfDelete in try-catch for axios error handling
2. **State Management Complexity** - Managing multiple states (loading, editing, adding) required careful coordination
3. **Validation Timing** - Balancing client-side and server-side validation to avoid duplicating logic

### Recommendations for Future Features 💡

1. **Start with Security Review** - Having security requirements upfront guides implementation
2. **Mock Backend Early** - Frontend can start before backend is complete using mock responses
3. **Document Error Scenarios** - Clear error message requirements prevent ambiguity
4. **Consider Bulk Operations** - If users need to manage many items, plan for bulk actions early
