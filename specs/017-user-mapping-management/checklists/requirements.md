# Specification Quality Checklist: User Mapping Management in User Edit Interface

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-13

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All criteria met

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Validated**: 2025-10-13  
**Outcome**: PASSED

### Content Quality: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without HOW
- Business language used throughout (admin, user, mapping, access control)
- All mandatory sections present and complete

### Requirement Completeness: ✅ PASS
- 14 functional requirements, all testable and unambiguous
- 7 measurable success criteria with specific metrics (time, percentages)
- 12 Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios across 4 prioritized user stories
- 5 edge cases identified with handling guidance
- Scope bounded to user edit dialog mapping management
- 6 assumptions clearly documented

### Feature Readiness: ✅ PASS
- User stories prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable
- Each story delivers standalone value (View → Add/Delete → Edit)
- Success criteria align with functional requirements
- No implementation details present

## Notes

✅ Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phase
