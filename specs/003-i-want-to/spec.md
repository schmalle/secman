# Feature Specification: Vulnerability Management System

**Feature Branch**: `003-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i want to add a vulnerablity management function in the code. For this i want to have an upload function for vulnerabilities (see testdata directory, vulns.xlsx file) following a certain structure. The import functionality must be available via the Import function reachable from the sidebar. The upload function must ask, when the scan was made (use a nice UI here), so that every vulnerability is also allocated to a dedicated time stamp. If certain fields are not filled, leave them also empty. Vulnerabilities must be shown also in the asset inventory. If a vulnerability for a not known asset is found, create the asset and use meaningful defaults. Asset domain class must be extended by a group attribute, which may contain several strings, comma separated."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description clearly provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: vulnerability import, Excel upload, scan timestamp, asset creation, asset groups
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow defined for vulnerability import
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Vulnerability, Asset (extended), Scan metadata
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec has some uncertainties marked
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: When auto-creating assets from vulnerability data, what default values should be used for required fields? ‚Üí A: owner: "Security Team", type: "Server", description: "Auto-created from vulnerability scan"
- Q: What level of detail should the import feedback show to users? ‚Üí A: Counts with warnings: "X imported, Y skipped (invalid), Z assets created"
- Q: How should the system handle validation errors in the uploaded file? ‚Üí A: Skip invalid rows, import valid ones, report skipped rows in feedback
- Q: How should the system handle duplicate vulnerability entries for the same asset? ‚Üí A: Keep all as separate records - allow multiple entries (historical tracking)
- Q: When vulnerability data conflicts with existing asset information (e.g., different IP or groups), what should happen? ‚Üí A: Merge data - append new groups, update IP if changed, preserve other fields

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A security administrator receives vulnerability scan results in Excel format from their scanning tools. They need to import these vulnerabilities into the system, associating them with specific assets and tracking when the scan was performed. If vulnerabilities are found for assets not yet in the system, those assets should be automatically created. The administrator should be able to view vulnerabilities alongside asset information in the asset inventory.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an Excel file with vulnerability data and known assets in the system, **When** the administrator uploads the file via the Import page and specifies the scan date, **Then** all vulnerabilities are imported and linked to their respective assets, with the scan date recorded

2. **Given** an Excel file containing vulnerabilities for assets not in the system, **When** the administrator uploads the file, **Then** the system creates new asset records using information from the vulnerability file (hostname, IP, groups, OS version, etc.) with sensible defaults for required fields

3. **Given** an Excel file with some empty/missing fields, **When** the administrator uploads the file, **Then** the system imports the vulnerability data and leaves corresponding fields empty rather than rejecting the record

4. **Given** successfully imported vulnerabilities, **When** the administrator views the asset inventory, **Then** vulnerabilities are displayed for each asset

5. **Given** the administrator is on the Import page, **When** they prepare to upload a vulnerability file, **Then** they are prompted to specify when the scan was performed using an intuitive date/time picker

### Edge Cases
- What happens when uploading a file with no vulnerabilities (empty or header-only)?
- **Duplicate vulnerability entries**: System keeps all as separate records for historical tracking
- **Invalid file structure or missing required columns**: Skip invalid rows, import valid ones, report skipped rows in feedback
- **Existing asset with conflicting data**: Merge data - append new groups to existing ones, update IP if changed, preserve other fields
- What happens if the scan date is in the future or far in the past?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Data Import & Processing**
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload vulnerability data files in Excel format (.xlsx) via the Import page
- **FR-002**: System MUST prompt users to specify the scan date/time when uploading vulnerability files using an intuitive date/time picker interface
- **FR-003**: System MUST associate every imported vulnerability with the specified scan timestamp
- **FR-004**: System MUST accept vulnerability files with the following columns: Hostname, Local IP, Host groups, Cloud service account ID, Cloud service instance ID, OS version, Active Directory domain, Vulnerability ID, CVSS severity, Vulnerable product versions, Days open
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow empty/null values in non-critical fields and preserve them as empty rather than rejecting the record

**Asset Management**
- **FR-006**: System MUST check if an asset already exists (by hostname or identifying attribute) before creating a new one
- **FR-007**: System MUST create new asset records automatically when vulnerabilities reference unknown assets
- **FR-008**: System MUST populate new asset records using available data from the vulnerability file (hostname, IP, groups, OS version, AD domain, etc.)
- **FR-009**: System MUST use the following default values when creating assets from vulnerability data: owner: "Security Team", type: "Server", description: "Auto-created from vulnerability scan"
- **FR-010**: System MUST support storing multiple group memberships for each asset as comma-separated values

**Vulnerability Display & Association**
- **FR-011**: System MUST display vulnerabilities associated with each asset in the asset inventory view
- **FR-012**: System MUST link each vulnerability to its corresponding asset record
- **FR-013**: System MUST preserve the relationship between vulnerabilities and the scan that discovered them

**User Experience**
- **FR-014**: Vulnerability import functionality MUST be accessible from the existing Import page in the sidebar
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide import feedback showing counts with warnings: "X imported, Y skipped (invalid), Z assets created"
- **FR-016**: System MUST validate the uploaded file format and structure, skip invalid rows, import valid ones, and report skipped rows in the feedback

**Data Integrity**
- **FR-017**: System MUST keep all duplicate vulnerability entries as separate records to enable historical tracking
- **FR-018**: System MUST merge conflicting asset data by appending new groups to existing ones, updating IP if changed, and preserving other existing fields

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Vulnerability**: Represents a security vulnerability discovered during a scan. Contains vulnerability ID (e.g., CVE number), CVSS severity level, affected product versions, days open since discovery, and the timestamp when the scan was performed. Each vulnerability is associated with a specific asset.

- **Asset (Extended)**: Existing entity representing IT assets. Extended to include:
  - Group memberships (comma-separated list of groups the asset belongs to)
  - Cloud service account ID (for cloud-based assets)
  - Cloud service instance ID (for cloud-based assets)
  - Active Directory domain (for domain-joined assets)
  - OS version information

- **Scan Metadata**: Information about when a vulnerability scan was performed. Associated with all vulnerabilities imported from a single upload operation.
