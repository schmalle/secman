# Specification Quality Checklist: Outdated Asset Notification System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks met

**Details**:
- Specification is complete with 3 prioritized user stories (P1-P3)
- 20 functional requirements defined, all testable
- 10 success criteria defined, all measurable and technology-agnostic
- 7 edge cases identified with clear handling expectations
- No clarification markers - all questions were resolved during generation
- Assumptions section documents dependencies on Features 034, 013/016
- No technical implementation details (Kotlin, Micronaut, React) in specification
- User scenarios use Given/When/Then format with clear acceptance criteria

**Ready for next phase**: Yes - proceed with `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- Feature successfully leverages existing infrastructure (OutdatedAssetMaterializedView, UserMapping)
- User clarifications resolved: reuse Feature 034 logic, use UserMapping for emails, manual CLI execution
- Scope is well-bounded: notification system only, no changes to existing asset or vulnerability management
