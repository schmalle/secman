# Tasks: Outdated Asset Notification System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/035-notification-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED per TDD principle (Principle II). All test tasks are included and must be completed BEFORE implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/`
- **Backend Tests**: `src/backendng/src/test/kotlin/com/secman/`
- **Frontend**: `src/frontend/src/`
- **Frontend Tests**: `src/frontend/tests/`
- **CLI**: `src/cli/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/cli/`
- **Email Templates**: `src/backendng/src/main/resources/email-templates/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Checkpoint**: Basic infrastructure configured - ready for foundational implementation

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

- [X] T008 [P] Create NotificationLog entity in src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/domain/NotificationLog.kt

### Repository Layer

- [X] T010 [P] Create AssetReminderStateRepository in src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/repository/AssetReminderStateRepository.kt (findByAssetId)
- [X] T011 [P] Create NotificationLogRepository in src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/repository/NotificationLogRepository.kt (findBySentAtBetween, findByNotificationType)

### Core Services (Shared Across User Stories)

- [X] T012 Create EmailConfig in src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/config/EmailConfig.kt (JavaMail Session configuration)
- [X] T013 Create EmailTemplateService in src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/service/EmailTemplateService.kt (Thymeleaf rendering)
- [X] T014 Create ReminderStateService in src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/service/ReminderStateService.kt (track reminder levels 1‚Üí2)
- [X] T015 Create NotificationLogService in src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/service/NotificationLogService.kt (audit trail creation)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - Integrates with US1 (uses same NotificationService) but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - Reads NotificationLog created by US1/US2 but independently testable
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ MVP
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with NotificationService from US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Reads NotificationLog entities but independently testable

**Recommendation**: Complete US1 first (MVP), then US2 and US3 can be developed in parallel if team capacity allows.

### Within Each User Story

- **TDD Order**: Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- **Entity Order**: Entities ‚Üí Repositories ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Controllers/UI
- **Template Order**: Email templates before service implementation that uses them
- **Integration Order**: Core implementation before error handling and edge cases

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase**:
- T002, T003 (dependency management) can run in parallel

**Foundational Phase**:
- T005, T006, T007, T008 (all entities) can run in parallel
- T009, T010, T011 (all repositories) can run in parallel after entities complete

**User Story 1**:
- All test tasks (T016-T021) can run in parallel
- All email template tasks (T022-T025) can run in parallel
- T036, T037, T038, T039 (error handling) can run in parallel

**User Story 2**:
- All test tasks (T043-T048) can run in parallel
- T049, T052 (controller and API client) can run in parallel
- T056, T057 (email templates) can run in parallel

**User Story 3**:
- All test tasks (T065-T070) can run in parallel
- T071, T076 (controller and API client) can run in parallel

**Polish Phase**:
- T089, T090, T091, T092, T093, T095, T096 can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (must FAIL initially):
Task: "Write contract test for CLI command execution in SendNotificationsCommandTest.kt"
Task: "Write unit test for NotificationService email aggregation logic"
Task: "Write unit test for ReminderStateService level escalation"
Task: "Write unit test for EmailTemplateService template rendering"
Task: "Write integration test for email sending end-to-end"
Task: "Write integration test for full notification workflow"

# Launch all email templates together:
Task: "Create Level 1 reminder HTML template in outdated-reminder-level1.html"
Task: "Create Level 1 reminder plain-text template in outdated-reminder-level1.txt"
Task: "Create Level 2 reminder HTML template in outdated-reminder-level2.html"
Task: "Create Level 2 reminder plain-text template in outdated-reminder-level2.txt"

# Launch all error handling tasks together:
Task: "Add SMTP failure handling to NotificationService"
Task: "Add missing UserMapping handling to NotificationService"
Task: "Add null Asset.owner handling to NotificationService"
Task: "Add state reset logic to NotificationService"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T015) - CRITICAL BLOCKER
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T016-T042)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run CLI command with test data, verify emails sent correctly
5. Deploy/demo if ready - Core notification functionality is complete

**Estimated Effort**: ~60% of total project (MVP delivers core value)

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Sprint 1**: Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (T001-T015)
2. **Sprint 2**: User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!) (T016-T042)
3. **Sprint 3**: User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (T043-T064)
4. **Sprint 4**: User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (T065-T088)
5. **Sprint 5**: Polish ‚Üí Production-ready (T089-T099)

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers (after Foundational phase complete):

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (T001-T015)
2. **Once Foundational is done**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (CLI + outdated reminders)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (frontend preferences + new vuln notifications)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (ADMIN audit log UI)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

**Note**: US1 should be prioritized (it's the MVP). US2 and US3 can be done in parallel if team size allows.

- Controllers: 6 tasks
- CLI: 7 tasks
- Frontend: 12 tasks
- Email Templates: 6 tasks
- Configuration: 4 tasks
- Polish/Documentation: 11 tasks
- Verification: 3 tasks

**Parallelizable Tasks**: 51 tasks marked [P]

**Critical Path**: Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí User Story 1 (MVP) = 42 tasks minimum for MVP

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **TDD enforced**: All tests written BEFORE implementation (Principle II)
- **Each user story independently completable and testable**
- **Verify tests fail before implementing** (Red-Green-Refactor)
- **Commit after each task or logical group**
- **Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently**
- **Performance target**: Process 10,000 assets in <2 minutes (verified in T098)
- **Coverage target**: ‚â•80% (verified in T099)

**Anti-patterns to avoid**:
- ‚ùå Implementing before writing tests
- ‚ùå Creating cross-story dependencies that break independence
- ‚ùå Working on same file in parallel (not marked [P])
- ‚ùå Skipping checkpoints (validate each story before moving on)
