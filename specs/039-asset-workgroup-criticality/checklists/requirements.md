## Validation Details

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: The specification describes WHAT the system should do (workgroups have criticality, assets inherit from workgroups) without specifying HOW (no mention of Kotlin, enums, database columns, React components, etc.).

✅ **Focused on user value**: All user stories clearly articulate user needs and business value (e.g., "classify large groups of assets", "focus attention on critical components", "respond urgently to threats").

✅ **Written for non-technical stakeholders**: Language is business-focused using terms like "security administrator", "asset owner", "criticality level" rather than technical jargon.

✅ **All mandatory sections completed**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements (with Functional Requirements and Key Entities), and Success Criteria are all present and comprehensive.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: All clarification questions were resolved through user responses:
- Scope level: Both workgroup and asset levels with inheritance
- Criticality levels: 4 levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Behavior impact: Notification integration and reporting/dashboard integration

✅ **Requirements are testable and unambiguous**: Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-039) specifies clear, verifiable behavior. Examples:
- FR-001: "Workgroups MUST have a criticality attribute with exactly four possible values"
- FR-006: "When an asset belongs to multiple workgroups, the system MUST use the highest criticality"
- FR-026: "CRITICAL asset vulnerabilities MUST trigger immediate notifications (within 1 hour)"

✅ **Success criteria are measurable**: All success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "within 30 minutes"
- SC-002: "90% of assets... within 2 weeks"
- SC-003: "under 2 seconds for datasets with up to 10,000 assets"
- SC-004: "40% reduction... measured via user survey"

✅ **Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: No implementation details in success criteria. They focus on user-facing outcomes and performance metrics without mentioning specific technologies.

✅ **All acceptance scenarios are defined**: Each of the 5 user stories includes detailed acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format, covering normal flows, edge cases, and error conditions.

✅ **Edge cases are identified**: Comprehensive edge case section covers:
- Workgroup deletion
- Asset movement between workgroups
- Multiple workgroup membership with different criticalities
- Bulk import scenarios
- Access control violations
- Existing data migration
- Concurrent updates

✅ **Scope is clearly bounded**: The specification clearly defines:
- **In scope**: Workgroup criticality, asset criticality overrides, inheritance logic, UI filters/sorting, notification integration, dashboard integration
- **Out of scope** (implied by absence): Criticality for other entities (users, vulnerabilities, requirements), complex workflow automation, AI-based criticality suggestions

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions identified**:
- Dependencies: Features 035 (Notifications), 034 (Outdated Assets Dashboard), 036 (Vulnerability Statistics)
- Assumptions: RBAC system, 4-level scale alignment, inheritance model appropriateness, color accessibility, default values, system capacity

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: Each FR is independently testable. Example: FR-006 can be tested by creating an asset with multiple workgroups of different criticalities and verifying the highest is used.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 5 prioritized user stories cover:
- P1: Core functionality (workgroup baseline)
- P2: Advanced functionality (asset overrides)
- P3: Usability (filtering/sorting)
- P4: Integration (notifications)
- P5: Reporting (dashboards/analytics)

✅ **Feature meets measurable outcomes**: Each success criterion directly corresponds to user value:
- SC-001 to SC-003: Efficiency and performance
- SC-004 to SC-005: Productivity improvements
- SC-006 to SC-010: Reporting and visibility

✅ **No implementation details leak**: The specification maintains abstraction throughout, describing the system from a user/business perspective without prescribing technical solutions.

## Notes

- **Specification Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING
- **Quality Assessment**: Excellent - comprehensive, testable, and business-focused
- **Recommended Next Step**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation design artifacts
- **User Clarifications Resolved**: 3 critical decisions were clarified with the user:
  1. Scope level: Both levels with inheritance (most flexible approach)
  2. Criticality levels: 4-level standard (aligns with CVSS)
  3. Behavior impact: Notification integration + reporting (balanced scope)

## Checklist Status: ✅ ALL ITEMS PASSED

This specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the planning phase.
