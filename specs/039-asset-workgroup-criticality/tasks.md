# Tasks: Asset and Workgroup Criticality Classification

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/039-asset-workgroup-criticality/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Following TDD principle (Principle II), tests MUST be written before implementation. Test tasks are included per constitutional requirement.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app** (per plan.md): `src/backendng/`, `src/frontend/`
- Backend: `src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/`
- Frontend: `src/frontend/src/`
- Tests: `src/backendng/src/test/kotlin/com/secman/`, `src/frontend/tests/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Verify environment and prepare for implementation

- [X] T001 Verify MariaDB connection and Hibernate configuration in `src/backendng/src/main/resources/application.yml`
- [X] T002 Verify frontend development environment (npm, Astro 5.14, React 19) in `src/frontend/`
- [X] T003 [P] Create backup of current database schema for rollback capability

**Checkpoint**: Environment verified - implementation can begin

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core criticality infrastructure that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

### Foundational Tests (TDD - Write These FIRST)

- [ ] T004 [P] Write unit tests for Criticality enum helper methods in `src/backendng/src/test/kotlin/com/secman/domain/CriticalityTest.kt`

- [ ] T006 Run unit tests for Criticality enum - verify all tests pass before proceeding

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Set Workgroup Baseline Criticality (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable security administrators to assign criticality levels to workgroups with inheritance to assets

**Independent Test**: Create/edit a workgroup, set criticality level, verify assets inherit the criticality. Fully functional without P2-P5 features.

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (User Story 1 Only)

For minimal viable product, implement **only Phase 1-3** (User Story 1):
- Workgroups have criticality
- Assets inherit from workgroups
- UI displays badges with basic filters/sorting
- **Estimated effort**: 4-6 hours

This delivers immediate value: bulk asset classification via workgroups.

### Incremental Delivery

- **Sprint 1** (MVP): User Story 1 (T001-T036) - 4-6 hours
- **Sprint 2**: User Story 2 (T037-T060) - 2-3 hours
- **Sprint 3**: User Story 3 (T061-T075) - 2-3 hours
- **Sprint 4**: User Story 4 (T076-T083) - 1-2 hours
- **Sprint 5**: User Story 5 (T084-T095) - 2-3 hours
- **Sprint 6**: Polish (T096-T105) - 1-2 hours

**Total estimated effort**: 12-19 hours following TDD workflow

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

Within each user story phase, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel:

**User Story 1 Example**:
- Tests T007-T014 can all run in parallel (different test files)
- Backend tasks T015-T016 can run in parallel (different entity files)
- Backend DTO tasks T018-T020 can run in parallel (same file, different sections)
- Frontend component tasks T029 and T036 can run in parallel (different files)

**Key Constraint**: Tasks affecting the same file MUST run sequentially unless they modify independent sections.

### User Story Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup)
    ‚Üì
Phase 2 (Foundational - Criticality enum)
    ‚Üì
Phase 3 (US1 - Workgroup Criticality) ‚Üê MVP
    ‚Üì
Phase 4 (US2 - Asset Override) ‚Üê Independent, depends on US1
    ‚Üì
Phase 5 (US3 - Filter/Sort) ‚Üê Independent, depends on US1+US2
    ‚Üì
Phase 6 (US4 - Notifications) ‚Üê Depends on US1+US2, Feature 035
    ‚Üì
Phase 7 (US5 - Dashboards) ‚Üê Depends on US1+US2, Features 034+036
    ‚Üì
Phase 8 (Polish)
```

**Note**: User Stories 2-5 can theoretically be implemented in parallel AFTER US1 is complete, but sequential implementation is recommended to reduce complexity and enable incremental testing.
