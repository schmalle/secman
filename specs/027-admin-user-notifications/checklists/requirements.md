# Specification Quality Checklist: Admin User Notification System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
- Specification describes WHAT users need (email notifications for new users) and WHY (security awareness, audit trail)
- No technical implementation details (no mention of specific email libraries, frameworks, or code structure)
- Written in business language that non-technical stakeholders can understand
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete and actionable
- All 15 functional requirements are testable with clear expected behaviors:
  - FR-001: Can test by accessing Admin UI and verifying toggle exists
  - FR-003: Can test by creating user and counting emails sent to admins
  - FR-011: Can test by simulating email failure and verifying user creation succeeds
- All 7 success criteria are measurable:
  - SC-001: 30 seconds (time-based)
  - SC-002: 2 minutes (time-based)
  - SC-003: 99% delivery rate (percentage)
  - SC-004: 3 seconds (time-based)
  - SC-005: 100% formatting compliance (percentage)
  - SC-006: Zero failures (count)
  - SC-007: Qualitative feedback (user satisfaction)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of SMTP, JavaMail, or specific tech)
- All 5 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios using Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases comprehensively cover error scenarios (no admins, invalid emails, transaction failures, etc.)
- Scope clearly bounded to notification system (does not include changing user management itself)
- Dependencies implicitly identified (requires existing email infrastructure, existing user management)

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- Each of 15 functional requirements maps to specific acceptance scenarios in user stories
- 5 prioritized user stories cover all flows:
  - P1: Configuration (US1) and manual user creation (US2)
  - P2: OAuth registration (US3) and email formatting (US4)
  - P3: Delivery reliability (US5)
- Feature delivers all measurable outcomes: admin control, email delivery, non-blocking behavior, professional formatting
- No implementation leakage detected - specification remains at business/user level

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (though clarification may not be needed given completeness).

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization (P1-P3) with justification
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Non-blocking design explicitly called out (FR-011, SC-004, SC-006)
- Security-focused (only ADMIN users receive/configure, audit logging)
- Professional quality standards (HTML formatting, consistent content)

**No issues or concerns identified.**
