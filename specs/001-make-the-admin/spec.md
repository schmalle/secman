# Feature Specification: Admin Sidebar Visibility Control

**Feature Branch**: `001-make-the-admin`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "make the admin sidebar entry only visible if the logged in user has the ROLE ADMIN"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature clear: Conditional sidebar visibility based on user role
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Admin users, Regular users
   ‚Üí Actions: View sidebar, Access admin section
   ‚Üí Data: User roles (specifically ROLE_ADMIN)
   ‚Üí Constraints: Admin menu item visible only to admin role holders
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí None identified - requirement is clear
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Scenarios defined for both admin and non-admin users
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí User entity with roles property
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:

2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
When a user logs into the system, the sidebar navigation should display menu items appropriate to their role. Users with administrative privileges (ROLE_ADMIN) need access to the Admin menu item to perform administrative tasks, while regular users should not see this option as they do not have the necessary permissions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user with ROLE_ADMIN is authenticated and viewing any page with the sidebar, **When** the sidebar renders, **Then** the Admin menu item is visible and accessible
2. **Given** a user without ROLE_ADMIN (regular user with only ROLE_USER) is authenticated and viewing any page with the sidebar, **When** the sidebar renders, **Then** the Admin menu item is not visible in the navigation
3. **Given** an unauthenticated user attempts to access the application, **When** they are prompted to log in, **Then** no sidebar is displayed until authentication is successful
4. **Given** an admin user clicks on the Admin menu item, **When** the navigation occurs, **Then** they are taken to the admin section successfully
5. **Given** a user's role is changed from ADMIN to USER (via administrative action), **When** they refresh or navigate to another page, **Then** the Admin menu item is no longer visible

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user has their admin role revoked while they are actively using the system?
  - The Admin menu item should disappear on the next page navigation or sidebar re-render
- What happens if user role data is unavailable or corrupted?
  - The system should default to not showing the Admin menu item (fail-safe approach)
- What happens when a regular user manually navigates to the admin URL?
  - This is outside the scope of this feature (sidebar visibility only), but the backend should still enforce authorization

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display the Admin sidebar menu item only to authenticated users who have ROLE_ADMIN
- **FR-002**: System MUST hide the Admin sidebar menu item from all users who do not have ROLE_ADMIN
- **FR-003**: System MUST check the current user's roles when rendering the sidebar to determine Admin menu visibility
- **FR-004**: System MUST reflect role changes in sidebar visibility when the user navigates between pages or the sidebar re-renders
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain visibility of all other sidebar menu items (Dashboard, Requirements, Standards, Norms, Assets, UseCases, Import/Export, Risk Management, About) regardless of admin role status
- **FR-006**: System MUST gracefully handle missing or invalid user role data by defaulting to hiding the Admin menu item

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents an authenticated user in the system with properties including:
  - Unique identifier
  - Username
  - Email address
  - Collection of roles (ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_USER)
  - Authentication status
- **Role**: Represents a permission level assigned to users
  - ROLE_ADMIN: Administrative access level
  - ROLE_USER: Standard user access level
