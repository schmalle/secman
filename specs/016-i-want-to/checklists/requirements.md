# Specification Quality Checklist: CSV-Based User Mapping Upload

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (resolved: domain field uses "-NONE-" sentinel value)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Resolution Completed** (2025-10-13):
- **FR-EXT-004** domain field handling clarification **RESOLVED**
  - **User Decision**: Use sentinel value "-NONE-" for domain when CSV lacks domain column
  - **Implementation**: System will automatically assign domain = "-NONE-" for CSV uploads without domain column
  - **Flexibility**: Optional domain column in CSV allows explicit domain specification if needed
  - **Updated**: FR-EXT-004 (line 86-88), Assumptions #10, UserMapping note, Review Checklist

**Validation Result**: âœ… **PASSED** - All checklist items complete. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
