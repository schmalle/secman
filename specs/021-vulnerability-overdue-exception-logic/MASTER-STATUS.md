## ✅ What's Working (Production Ready)

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
- ✅ **Vulnerability Config Management**
  - Admin can set "Reminder One" threshold (default: 30 days)
  - Stored in database with validation (1-365 days)
  - GET/PUT API endpoints with ADMIN auth
  
- ✅ **Overdue Status Calculation**
  - Automatic age calculation from scan timestamp
  - Three states: OK, OVERDUE, EXCEPTED
  - Days overdue computed when > threshold
  - Exception matching integrated
  
- ✅ **Frontend Integration**
  - Config form in Admin page
  - Overdue status badges (color-coded)
  - Status filtering in vulnerabilities table
  - Exception info displayed

**What Works**: Admin sets threshold → System calculates overdue → Users see badges

### Phase 2: Asset Exceptions ✅
- ✅ **ASSET Exception Type**
  - New exception type alongside IP/PRODUCT
  - Matches by asset database ID
  - Survives IP address changes
  - CASCADE delete when asset deleted
  
- ✅ **Asset Selection UI**
  - 3-way radio selector (IP/PRODUCT/ASSET)
  - Asset dropdown with name + IP display
  - Context-sensitive help and validation
  - Asset name shown in exceptions table
  
- ✅ **Complete Integration**
  - Backend validates asset exists
  - Frontend fetches assets from API
  - Exceptions suppress overdue status
  - Professional Bootstrap 5 UI

**What Works**: Create asset exception → All vulnerabilities on that asset excluded from overdue

## 🎯 Current Capabilities

### ✅ What Users Can Do Now

**Admin Users**:
1. Set vulnerability overdue threshold (Reminder One)
2. View all vulnerability exceptions
3. Create exceptions by IP, Product, or Asset
4. Delete exceptions (no confirmation yet)
5. See all vulnerabilities with overdue status

**Regular Users**:
1. View current vulnerabilities
2. See overdue status badges (OK/OVERDUE/EXCEPTED)
3. Filter by overdue status
4. See exception details (reason, expiration)
5. Understand why vulnerabilities are excepted

**System**:
1. Auto-calculates vulnerability age
2. Determines overdue status based on threshold
3. Matches exceptions (IP/PRODUCT/ASSET types)
4. Suppresses overdue for excepted vulnerabilities
5. Shows exception info and expiration

### ❌ What's Not Yet Implemented

**Exception Management**:

- ❌ Audit trail of exception changes
- ❌ Delete confirmation with impact analysis
- ❌ Exception history view

**Product Exceptions**:
- ❌ See how many vulnerabilities affected
- ❌ Product autocomplete from existing data
- ❌ Preview impact before creating
- ❌ Performance optimization for large datasets

**Analytics**:
- ❌ Exception usage statistics
- ❌ Overdue trends dashboard
- ❌ Exception effectiveness metrics
- ❌ Export/reporting capabilities
