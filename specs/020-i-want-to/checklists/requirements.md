# Specification Quality Checklist: IP Address Mapping to Users

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED (2025-10-15)

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete and ready for planning.

**Clarifications Resolved**:
- IPv4/IPv6 Support: IPv4 fully supported in MVP with IPv6 validation stub for future enhancement
- Overlapping Ranges: Allowed with most permissive approach (asset visible to all users whose ranges match)

**Key Strengths**:
- 5 prioritized, independently testable user stories (P1-P3)
- 28 functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
- 10 measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- 6 edge cases documented with resolution strategies
- Clear dependencies on Features 013, 016, 018

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase. No blocking issues identified.
