# Specification Quality Checklist: Vulnerability Exception Request & Approval Workflow

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✅

- **No implementation details**: Specification describes WHAT users need without mentioning Kotlin, React, Micronaut, TypeScript, database tables, API endpoints, or other technical details.
- **User-focused**: All requirements written from user perspective with clear business value.
- **Non-technical language**: Uses plain language suitable for business stakeholders (e.g., "System MUST display..." rather than "Frontend component shall render...").
- **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✅

- **No clarification markers**: All three clarifying questions were resolved with user input. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain in the specification.
- **Testable requirements**: Each of 34 functional requirements is specific and verifiable (e.g., FR-004: "Reason field: minimum 50 characters, maximum 2048 characters").
- **Measurable success criteria**: All 12 success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., SC-001: "under 2 minutes", SC-007: "100% of exception requests").
- **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: No mention of technologies in success criteria (e.g., "pages load within 3 seconds" not "React components render in 3 seconds").
- **Acceptance scenarios defined**: 8 user stories with 28 total acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format.
- **Edge cases identified**: 10 edge cases documented with expected behaviors.
- **Scope bounded**: 10 explicit "Out of Scope" items prevent scope creep.
- **Dependencies/assumptions**: 5 dependencies and 10 assumptions clearly documented.

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✅

- **Requirements have acceptance criteria**: Each functional requirement maps to user story acceptance scenarios or is testable as written (e.g., FR-033: "check if vulnerability already has PENDING or APPROVED request").
- **User scenarios cover flows**: 8 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) cover complete workflow from request creation → approval/rejection → notification → history → statistics.
- **Measurable outcomes defined**: 12 success criteria cover performance (5), accuracy (2), usability (2), and system reliability (3).
- **No implementation leakage**: Specification remains technology-agnostic throughout. No database schemas, API contracts, component hierarchies, or code-level details present.

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete (all mandatory sections populated)
- Clear (no ambiguous requirements or unresolved clarifications)
- Testable (all requirements verifiable without implementation knowledge)
- Technology-agnostic (suitable for non-technical stakeholders)
- Well-scoped (clear boundaries, dependencies, and assumptions)

**Next Steps**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan and task breakdown.

## Notes

- User clarifications resolved: Exception scope (flexible per-vulnerability or CVE pattern), integration approach (create actual exceptions on approval), and visibility model (users see only own requests).
- Priority structure is well-defined: P1 (MVP core workflow), P2 (enhanced UX), P3 (notifications and analytics).
- Edge cases are comprehensive, covering common failure scenarios like deleted users, expired vulnerabilities, and duplicate requests.
- Success criteria balance quantitative metrics (time, accuracy) with qualitative goals (user satisfaction, self-service capability).
