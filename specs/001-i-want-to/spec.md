**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i want to add MCP server functionality in secman."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: MCP server, integration with Secman security management system
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User flow: External applications connecting to Secman via MCP protocol
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

External applications and tools need to connect to Secman to programmatically access security requirements, risk assessments, and compliance data. Users want to integrate Secman's security management capabilities with other development tools, CI/CD pipelines, and enterprise systems through a standardized protocol interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an external application with MCP client capabilities, **When** it connects to Secman's MCP server, **Then** it can authenticate and establish a secure connection
2. **Given** an authenticated MCP client, **When** it requests security requirements data, **Then** it receives properly formatted requirement information with appropriate access controls
3. **Given** an MCP client with write permissions, **When** it submits new security requirements or risk assessments, **Then** the data is validated and stored in Secman's database
4. **Given** multiple MCP clients connected simultaneously, **When** they make concurrent requests, **Then** the server handles them efficiently without data corruption

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an MCP client loses connection during a large data transfer?
- How does the system handle malformed MCP protocol messages?
- What occurs when an MCP client attempts to access data beyond its permission level?
- How does the system respond when maximum concurrent connections are reached?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an MCP server endpoint that external applications can connect to
- FR-001b: System must be able to generate API keys via web UI
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate MCP clients before allowing data access via API keys
- **FR-003**: System MUST expose security requirements data through MCP protocol messages
- **FR-004**: System MUST expose risk assessment data through MCP protocol messages
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow authorized MCP clients to create new security requirements
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow authorized MCP clients to update existing requirements and assessments
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate all incoming data from MCP clients according to Secman's business rules
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain audit logs of all MCP client interactions
- **FR-009**: System MUST enforce role-based access control for MCP client operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle MCP protocol version negotiation using latest stable MCP protocol version.
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide error handling and status reporting through MCP protocol
- **FR-012**: System MUST support concurrent MCP client connections up to a limit of 200 clients.
- **FR-013**: System MUST gracefully handle MCP client disconnections and cleanup resources
- FR-014: User documentation for connecting Claude and ChatGPT to system must be generated.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **MCP Connection**: Represents active connection from external client, including authentication state and permissions
- **MCP Message**: Protocol messages exchanged between server and clients, containing requests and responses
- **Client Session**: Persistent session data for authenticated MCP clients, tracking activity and access patterns
- **Access Control Rule**: Defines what operations and data each MCP client is authorized to access
