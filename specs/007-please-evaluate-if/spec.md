# Feature Specification: Backend Dependency Evaluation and Update

**Feature Branch**: `007-please-evaluate-if`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "please evaluate if the backend is using the latest dependency versions. If not, update the dependencies and fix any issues that arise."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: Dependency version evaluation and update
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Development team, Build system
   ‚Üí Actions: Evaluate versions, update dependencies, fix issues
   ‚Üí Data: Dependency versions, compatibility reports
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must maintain compatibility, fix breaking changes
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí None identified - task is maintenance-focused
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer workflow defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí No new entities - infrastructure task
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details, spec ready
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team, we need to ensure that the backend application uses the latest stable versions of all dependencies to benefit from security patches, bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features. When dependencies are updated, any compatibility issues or breaking changes must be identified and resolved to maintain application stability.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the backend has existing dependencies, **When** a dependency evaluation is performed, **Then** the system identifies which dependencies have newer versions available
2. **Given** outdated dependencies are identified, **When** updates are applied, **Then** the application builds successfully without errors
3. **Given** dependencies are updated, **When** breaking changes occur, **Then** the necessary code adjustments are made to restore functionality
4. **Given** all dependencies are updated, **When** the test suite runs, **Then** all tests pass successfully

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a dependency update introduces breaking API changes?
- How does the system handle transitive dependency conflicts after updates?
- What if a newer version requires a different minimum runtime version?
- How are deprecated dependencies identified and replaced?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST identify all current dependency versions used in the backend
- **FR-002**: System MUST compare current versions against the latest stable releases available
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate a report showing which dependencies have updates available
- **FR-004**: System MUST update dependencies to their latest stable versions where compatible
- **FR-005**: System MUST identify any breaking changes or compatibility issues introduced by updates
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure the application builds successfully after dependency updates
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure all existing tests pass after dependency updates
- **FR-008**: System MUST resolve any code incompatibilities caused by dependency updates
- **FR-009**: System MUST document any significant changes or migration steps required by dependency updates
- **FR-010**: System MUST verify that security vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies are resolved

### Key Entities
Not applicable - this is a maintenance task that does not introduce new data entities.
