## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Own Profile Information (Priority: P1)

As a logged-in user, I want to view my profile information so that I can verify my email address and understand what roles/permissions I have in the system.

**Why this priority**: This is the core MVP functionality - allowing users to see their own identity and permissions is essential for transparency and helps users understand why they can or cannot access certain features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as any user, clicking "Profile" in the upper-right dropdown menu, and verifying that the profile page displays the correct email and roles for that user.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in as a user, **When** I click the "Profile" menu item in the upper-right dropdown, **Then** I am navigated to my profile page
2. **Given** I navigate to the profile page, **When** data is being fetched, **Then** I see a loading spinner or skeleton UI in the content area
3. **Given** I am on my profile page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see "User Profile" as the main page heading
4. **Given** I am on my profile page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see my email address displayed correctly
5. **Given** I am on my profile page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see all my assigned roles displayed (e.g., "ADMIN, USER" or "VULN, USER")
6. **Given** I am a user with multiple roles, **When** I view my profile, **Then** all roles are displayed as colored badge pills
7. **Given** I am a user with only the USER role, **When** I view my profile, **Then** I see "USER" displayed as a badge
8. **Given** the backend API fails to return my profile data, **When** I am on the profile page, **Then** I see a user-friendly error message with a "Retry" button
9. **Given** I see an error message on the profile page, **When** I click the "Retry" button, **Then** the system attempts to fetch my profile data again

### User Story 2 - Navigate to Profile from User Menu (Priority: P1)

As a logged-in user, I want to access my profile page from the user menu in the upper-right corner so that I can quickly view my information without navigating through multiple pages.

**Why this priority**: This is part of the MVP - the navigation pattern is a critical UX requirement that makes the feature accessible.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that the "Profile" menu item appears in the user dropdown menu and clicking it successfully navigates to the profile page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I click on my username in the upper-right corner, **Then** I see a dropdown menu with "Profile" as one of the options
2. **Given** the user dropdown menu is open, **When** I click "Profile", **Then** I am navigated to `/profile` (or similar URL)
3. **Given** I am on any page in the application, **When** I access the profile from the user menu, **Then** the navigation works consistently

### User Story 3 - View Username on Profile (Priority: P2)

As a logged-in user, I want to see my username displayed on my profile page so that I can confirm my account identity.

**Why this priority**: While email and roles are the primary requirements, showing the username provides additional context and confirmation of identity, enhancing the user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that the username (the identifier shown in the upper-right corner) is displayed on the profile page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on my profile page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see my username displayed prominently
2. **Given** my username is "adminuser", **When** I view my profile, **Then** the page shows "adminuser" as my username

---

### User Story 4 - Profile Page Layout and Design (Priority: P2)

As a logged-in user, I want the profile page to have a clean, readable layout so that I can easily find and understand my information.

**Why this priority**: Good UX is important but secondary to the core functionality. This ensures the information is presented in a user-friendly manner.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by visual inspection of the profile page for proper formatting, spacing, and readability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on my profile page, **When** I view the page, **Then** information is organized in clear sections or cards
2. **Given** I have multiple roles, **When** I view them on my profile, **Then** they are displayed as colored badge pills with one badge per role
3. **Given** I am viewing the profile page on different screen sizes, **When** the page renders, **Then** it is responsive and readable on mobile, tablet, and desktop

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has no email address in their account? (Display placeholder like "Not set" or "N/A")
- What happens when a user has no roles assigned? (Should not occur in normal operation, but display warning or default to "No roles assigned")
- What happens if a user's role is updated while they are viewing their profile? (Profile shows current state at page load; user must refresh to see updates)
- What happens when an OAuth user views their profile? (Display their OAuth-provided email)
- What happens if the user navigates directly to the profile URL? (Page loads normally if authenticated; redirects to login if not authenticated)
- What happens if the backend API fails to return profile data? (Display user-friendly error message with "Retry" button; clicking retry re-fetches data)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Key Entities

- **SC-002**: Profile page loads and displays user information in under 1 second for 95% of requests

- **SC-004**: Profile page is accessible and functional on all supported devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) with 100% feature parity
- **SC-005**: Zero security incidents related to users viewing other users' profile data

## Scope & Boundaries *(mandatory)*

### In Scope

- Display current user's email address
- Display current user's username
- Display current user's assigned roles
- Add "Profile" navigation item to user dropdown menu
- Create dedicated profile page route/URL
- Authentication check for profile page access
- Responsive design for profile page
- Read-only view of user information

### Out of Scope

- Editing profile information (email, username, password)
- Changing user roles (remains admin-only function)
- Viewing other users' profiles
- Profile pictures or avatars
- Additional profile fields beyond email, username, and roles
- Profile activity history or audit logs
- Account deletion or deactivation from profile page
- Two-factor authentication settings
- API key management
- Session management or active sessions view

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

1. The existing authentication system provides access to the current user's session data including username, email, and roles
2. The user dropdown menu in the upper-right corner already exists and can be extended with additional menu items
3. All users have at least one role assigned (minimum: USER role)
4. Email addresses are stored for all users (manually created users have required email; OAuth users receive email from provider)
5. The application uses a standard routing mechanism that can accommodate a new `/profile` route
6. The existing UI framework (Bootstrap 5.3) will be used for styling the profile page
7. No special permissions beyond authentication are required to view one's own profile
8. Profile data does not include sensitive information beyond email and roles (no password display, etc.)
9. The application layout includes the upper-right user menu on all authenticated pages

## Dependencies

- Authentication system must provide current user context (username, email, roles)
- User dropdown menu component in the application header/navbar
- Application routing system for creating new page route
- Existing UI component library (Bootstrap 5.3 as per project tech stack)

## Open Questions

None - all requirements are clear and can be implemented with reasonable defaults.
