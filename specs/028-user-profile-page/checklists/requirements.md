# Specification Quality Checklist: User Profile Page

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Details

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on WHAT users need, not HOW to implement. Bootstrap 5.3 is mentioned only in assumptions (existing tech stack context), not as an implementation requirement.

✅ **User value focused**: All requirements and user stories emphasize user needs (transparency, understanding permissions, quick access).

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written in business/user terms without technical jargon.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope & Boundaries, Assumptions) are filled out.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No clarification markers**: All requirements are specified without [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-002 "display email" is testable by checking if email appears on page).

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items include specific metrics (100% access within 2 clicks, <1s load time, 0 security incidents, 90% user satisfaction).

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes, not technical metrics (e.g., "Profile page loads in under 1 second" not "API response time <200ms").

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story has Given-When-Then scenarios covering primary and edge cases.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 5 edge cases documented (no email, no roles, role updates during view, OAuth users, direct URL navigation).

✅ **Scope bounded**: Clear In Scope and Out of Scope sections define what will and won't be built.

✅ **Dependencies identified**: Authentication system, user menu component, routing, UI library all documented.

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Clear acceptance criteria**: All 10 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-010) are specific and testable.

✅ **Primary flows covered**: 4 user stories cover the core flows (view profile, navigate to profile, view username, layout/design).

✅ **Measurable outcomes**: 6 success criteria provide clear metrics for feature success.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification remains at the business/user level throughout.

## Notes

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan` or direct implementation via `/speckit.implement`.

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization (P1 for MVP, P2 for enhancements)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Well-defined scope boundaries
- Measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- Independent, testable user stories

**No issues identified** - specification meets all quality standards.
