# Requirements Checklist: CrowdStrike Asset Auto-Creation

**Purpose**: Validate specification quality and completeness for Feature 030
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist validates the specification against quality criteria before proceeding to planning phase.

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW (no implementation details) ✅ User-focused, no code/class references
- [x] CHK002 User stories are written from user perspective, not technical perspective ✅ All stories describe user actions and outcomes
- [x] CHK003 Requirements describe behavior and outcomes, not code structure ✅ FR-001 to FR-016 describe system behavior
- [x] CHK004 No references to specific classes, methods, or code patterns ✅ Only entity concepts, no implementation
- [x] CHK005 Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders ✅ Clear, business-focused language
- [x] CHK006 Edge cases describe scenarios, not error handling code ✅ 7 edge cases with expected outcomes

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK007 All functional requirements are testable and measurable ✅ All 16 FRs can be objectively verified
- [x] CHK008 Each requirement has clear acceptance criteria or can be validated objectively ✅ User stories have Given-When-Then scenarios
- [x] CHK009 Success criteria are quantifiable (performance targets, percentages, counts) ✅ SC-001 to SC-006 all measurable
- [x] CHK010 User stories include Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios ✅ All 3 user stories have acceptance scenarios
- [x] CHK011 Priority levels (P1, P2, P3) are assigned and justified ✅ All stories prioritized with rationale
- [x] CHK012 Independent test criteria defined for each user story ✅ "Independent Test" section in all stories
- [x] CHK013 Edge cases cover failure scenarios, boundary conditions, and race conditions ✅ 7 comprehensive edge cases

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK014 No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification ✅ Complete specification
- [x] CHK015 All assumptions are explicitly documented ✅ 8 assumptions clearly listed
- [x] CHK016 Dependencies on existing systems are clearly identified ✅ 4 dependencies documented
- [x] CHK017 Out of scope items are defined to prevent scope creep ✅ 8 out-of-scope items listed
- [x] CHK018 Key entities and their relationships are described ✅ Asset, Vulnerability, User entities defined
- [x] CHK019 Success criteria align with functional requirements ✅ SC align with FR (performance, correctness, UX)
- [x] CHK020 User scenarios are complete and realistic ✅ Based on existing CrowdStrike workflow

## Specification Structure

- [x] CHK021 Feature metadata present (branch, created date, status, input) ✅ All metadata complete
- [x] CHK022 User Scenarios & Testing section is mandatory and complete ✅ 3 user stories + edge cases
- [x] CHK023 Requirements section is mandatory and complete ✅ 16 functional requirements
- [x] CHK024 Success Criteria section is mandatory and complete ✅ 6 measurable success criteria
- [x] CHK025 All user stories follow template structure (Why priority, Independent test, Acceptance scenarios) ✅ All 3 stories follow template
- [x] CHK026 Functional requirements use FR-XXX numbering ✅ FR-001 to FR-016
- [x] CHK027 Success criteria use SC-XXX numbering ✅ SC-001 to SC-006

## Technical Feasibility

- [x] CHK028 Feature builds on existing infrastructure (CrowdStrike integration, Asset/Vulnerability entities) ✅ Listed in dependencies
- [x] CHK029 No conflicts with existing workgroup-based access control ✅ FR-004 explicitly assigns no workgroups
- [x] CHK030 Authentication system supports required user identification ✅ Dependency on existing auth
- [x] CHK031 Database schema supports required fields (or changes are out of scope) ✅ Assumption states schema supports required fields
- [x] CHK032 Transactional requirements are feasible with current stack ✅ Assumption states transactional support exists
- [x] CHK033 UI already has "Save to Database" button to extend ✅ Assumption confirms button exists

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- Any failures should be addressed before proceeding to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- If specification needs changes, update spec.md and re-validate
- All items must pass before feature is ready for planning phase
