# Specification Quality Checklist: AI-Powered Norm Mapping

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items passed validation
- Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Model identifier `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5-20251101` mentioned in FR-002 is a business requirement (specific model requested by user), not implementation detail
