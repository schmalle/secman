# Specification Quality Checklist: Release Rework

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The Assumptions section documents the key decision that the status rename is backward-incompatible and requires migration of existing data.
- 15 functional requirements cover the full scope: status model (FR-001 through FR-007), UI switching (FR-008 through FR-010), exports (FR-011, FR-012), data preservation (FR-013), testing (FR-014), and session persistence (FR-015).
