# Feature Specification: Vulnerability Query Tool

**Feature Branch**: `002-implement-a-python`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "implement a python command line tool to query for falcon api (you are allowed to reach out to https://www.falconpy.io) for vulnerabilities. Use the environment keys for FALCON_CLIENT_ID, FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET, FALCON_CLOUD_REGION. Command line parameters must be type of device (CLIENT, SERVER, BOTH), criticality of vulnerabilities (MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL), days the must vulnerability must be open, optionally specify the active directory domain in which the systems are located, optionally the system name to be queried. The export must be definable like XLSX output, CSV output, txt output. The output for Excel must match the sample file found in /Users/flake/sources/misc/secman/testdata/vulns.xlsx."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: What is the expected maximum result set size for pagination? Should there be a result limit? ‚Üí A: No limit - retrieve all matching vulnerabilities regardless of count
- Q: What is the expected text format structure for TXT exports? ‚Üí A: Tab-delimited columns (same as CSV but with tabs)
- Q: What is the default file naming pattern when export path not specified? ‚Üí A: falcon_vulns_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.[ext]
- Q: What constitutes a "long-running" query threshold for progress indication? ‚Üí A: After 10 seconds if query still running
- Q: Should there be specific exit codes for different error types? ‚Üí A: Detailed exit codes (0=success, 1=auth error, 2=network error, 3=invalid arguments, 4=API error, 5=export error)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A security analyst needs to query the CrowdStrike Falcon platform for vulnerability information across their device fleet. They want to filter devices by type (client workstations, servers, or both) and focus on vulnerabilities of specific severity levels (medium, high, or critical) that have been open for a minimum number of days. The analyst should be able to narrow results by Active Directory domain and specific system names when investigating targeted areas. Results must be exportable in multiple formats (Excel, CSV, text) for reporting and analysis workflows.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** valid credentials are configured, **When** analyst queries for all critical vulnerabilities open for 30+ days on servers in the "CORP.LOCAL" domain, **Then** system returns filtered vulnerability list with device details, vulnerability metadata, and days open
2. **Given** a vulnerability query has been executed, **When** analyst selects Excel export format, **Then** system generates an XLSX file matching the standard vulnerability report format with columns for hostname, IP, host groups, cloud identifiers, OS version, AD domain, vulnerability ID, severity, affected product versions, and days open
3. **Given** analyst queries for specific hostname "WEB-SERVER-01", **When** results are exported to CSV format, **Then** system produces comma-delimited output with the same data structure
4. **Given** analyst requests vulnerabilities for both client and server devices, **When** filtering by multiple severity levels, **Then** system applies OR logic for severities and returns all matching records
5. **Given** no credentials are configured, **When** analyst attempts to query, **Then** system displays clear error message indicating missing authentication configuration

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no vulnerabilities match the specified criteria (empty result set)? System should display "0 vulnerabilities found" message and create empty export file with headers only (exit code 0)
- How does the system handle API authentication failures or invalid credentials? Display clear error message indicating authentication failure and exit with code 1
- What occurs if the Active Directory domain filter doesn't match any devices? Treat as empty result set (0 vulnerabilities found, exit code 0)
- How are API rate limits or throttling handled during large queries? Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff; if retries exhausted, display rate limit error and exit with code 4
- What happens when export file path is not writable or disk space is insufficient? Display file system error message and exit with code 5
- How are network timeouts or API unavailability communicated to the user? Display network connectivity error message and exit with code 2
- What occurs if a hostname filter matches multiple devices? Return all matching devices with their respective vulnerabilities

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Query & Filtering
- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate to CrowdStrike Falcon platform using configured credentials
- **FR-002**: System MUST query vulnerability data from the CrowdStrike Falcon platform
- **FR-003**: System MUST filter results by device type with options: CLIENT (workstations), SERVER, or BOTH
- **FR-004**: System MUST filter vulnerabilities by severity level: MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL (support multiple selections)
- **FR-005**: System MUST filter vulnerabilities that have been open for a minimum number of days (user-specified threshold)
- **FR-006**: System MUST support optional filtering by Active Directory domain name
- **FR-007**: System MUST support optional filtering by specific system hostname

- **FR-034**: System MUST handle API rate limiting gracefully with retry logic or clear messaging

### Key Entities

Attributes: hostname, local IP address, host group membership, cloud service identifiers (account ID, instance ID), operating system version, Active Directory domain membership, device type classification (client vs server)

- **Filter Criteria**: Represents user-specified query parameters. Attributes: device type selection (client/server/both), severity levels (medium/high/critical), minimum days open threshold, optional AD domain filter, optional hostname filter

- **Export Configuration**: Represents output formatting preferences. Attributes: export format (XLSX/CSV/TXT), file path or naming convention, column ordering (for structured formats)
