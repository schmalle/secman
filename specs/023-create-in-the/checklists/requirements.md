# Specification Quality Checklist: CrowdStrike CLI - Vulnerability Query Tool

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Clarifications Resolved ✅

All 3 clarifications have been resolved and incorporated into the specification:

1. **File Overwrite Behavior (User Story 4)**: CLI will prompt user for confirmation before overwriting existing export files (Option B). This prevents accidental data loss while maintaining workflow flexibility. Added as FR-015.

2. **Credential Source (FR-012)**: API credentials will be read from a configuration file (~/.secman/crowdstrike.conf or similar) with appropriate file permissions for security (Option B). This provides persistent configuration while maintaining security through file permissions.

3. **Logging Sensitive Data (FR-013)**: Logs will include only metadata (timestamps, HTTP status codes, error messages) and will NOT include sensitive vulnerability data or API response payloads (Option B). This protects sensitive information while maintaining troubleshooting capability.

### Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All specification quality checks pass:
- ✅ No implementation details present
- ✅ User-focused and business-oriented
- ✅ All requirements testable and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- ✅ Scope clearly defined with assumptions and dependencies documented
- ✅ Security considerations addressed
- ✅ Edge cases identified

The specification is complete and ready for the next phase: `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`
