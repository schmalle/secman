# Feature Specification: Email Functionality Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `003-correct-and-implement`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "correct and implement email functionality (existing admin ui must be reachable, email notifications must be able to be send out for new risk assessments, test email accounts must be created)"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Features: email notifications, admin UI accessibility, test accounts
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: administrators, system users
   � Actions: send notifications, access admin UI, create test accounts
   � Data: risk assessments, email configurations, user accounts
   � Constraints: existing admin UI must remain accessible
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Email server configuration details marked for clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear user flows for admin config and notification sending
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (email config, notifications, test accounts)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Some clarifications needed for email server details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

Administrators need to configure email settings and automatically send notifications when new risk assessments are created, while maintaining access to existing admin functionality for system management.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an administrator accesses the admin interface, **When** they navigate to email configuration, **Then** they can view and modify email server settings
2. **Given** email is properly configured, **When** a new risk assessment is created, **Then** relevant stakeholders receive an automatic email notification
3. **Given** administrators need to test email functionality, **When** they create test email accounts, **Then** they can validate email delivery without affecting real users
4. **Given** email functionality is being configured, **When** administrators access existing admin features, **Then** all previously available admin functions remain accessible and functional

### Edge Cases

- What happens when email server is unreachable during notification attempts?
- How does system handle invalid email addresses in notification lists?
- What occurs when email configuration is incomplete or invalid?
- How are failed email deliveries tracked and reported?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an accessible admin interface for email configuration management
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically send email notifications when new risk assessments are created
- **FR-003**: Administrators MUST be able to create and manage test email accounts for validation purposes
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain full accessibility to all existing admin UI features and functions
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate email configuration settings before activation
- **FR-006**: System MUST log all email notification attempts and their success/failure status
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow administrators to specify notification recipients for risk assessments
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle email delivery failures gracefully without disrupting other system functions
- **FR-009**: System MUST support SMTP and IMAP
- **FR-010**: System MUST store email configuration securely in database with a best of breed encryption

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Email Configuration**: Server settings, authentication credentials, sender information
- **Email Notification**: Message content, recipient lists, delivery status, timestamp
- **Test Email Account**: Account details, validation status, test results
- **Risk Assessment Notification**: Links risk assessments to email notifications, tracks delivery
