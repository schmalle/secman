# Specification Quality Checklist: CrowdStrike System Vulnerability Lookup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**First Validation Pass (2025-10-11)**:

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning.

**Content Quality**:
- The spec is written in business language focusing on what security analysts need to do and why
- No mention of specific frameworks or code structure
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- All 20 functional requirements are specific and testable (e.g., "MUST query CrowdStrike API for vulnerabilities from last 40 days with status OPEN")
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "under 10 seconds", "95% of cases", "100% of vulnerabilities")
- Edge cases cover boundary conditions (special characters, pagination, API errors, validation)
- Assumptions clearly document expectations about API credentials, data formats, and system behavior
- Dependencies and out-of-scope items are explicitly listed

**Feature Readiness**:
- Four prioritized user stories (P1-P3) with independent test scenarios
- Each story can be implemented and tested independently
- Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are specific enough to implement

**Status**: âœ… READY FOR PLANNING - Proceed to `/speckit.plan`
