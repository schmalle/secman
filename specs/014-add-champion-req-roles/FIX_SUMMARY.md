# Fix Summary - Requirements Overview Access Issue

## Issue
After implementing Feature 014, normal users (USER role) could not view the Requirements Overview page. The page appeared blank/white.

## Root Cause
The initial implementation restricted entire controller access:
- `NormController`: `@Secured("ADMIN", "CHAMPION", "REQ")`
- `StandardController`: `@Secured("ADMIN", "CHAMPION", "REQ")`
- `UseCaseController`: `@Secured("ADMIN", "CHAMPION", "REQ")`

This blocked **all** endpoints including GET (read) operations. The Requirements Overview page calls:
- `GET /api/norms` - to list norms for dropdowns/filters
- `GET /api/usecases` - to list use cases for dropdowns/filters
- `GET /api/standards` - to list standards for dropdowns/filters

These requests returned 403 Forbidden for USER role, causing the page to fail.

## Solution
Changed security model from controller-level to method-level authorization:

### Controller Level (All Users)
- Changed all three controllers to `@Secured(SecurityRule.IS_AUTHENTICATED)`
- This allows all authenticated users to access read operations

### Method Level (Privileged Users Only)
Added `@Secured("ADMIN", "CHAMPION", "REQ")` to write operations:
- All `@Post` methods (create operations)
- All `@Put` methods (update operations)
- All `@Delete` methods (delete operations)

### Access Pattern
**Before Fix**:
- Controller: ADMIN, CHAMPION, REQ only
- All methods: Inherit controller restriction
- Result: USER role blocked from GET operations ❌

**After Fix**:
- Controller: IS_AUTHENTICATED (all users)
- GET methods: Inherit controller (all users can read) ✅
- POST/PUT/DELETE methods: ADMIN, CHAMPION, REQ only (privileged write) ✅

## Files Modified

**Backend (3 files)**:
1. `src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/controller/NormController.kt`
   - Controller: Changed to `@Secured(SecurityRule.IS_AUTHENTICATED)`
   - Added `@Secured("ADMIN", "CHAMPION", "REQ")` to: POST, PUT, DELETE, DELETE /all

2. `src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/controller/StandardController.kt`
   - Controller: Changed to `@Secured(SecurityRule.IS_AUTHENTICATED)`
   - Added `@Secured("ADMIN", "CHAMPION", "REQ")` to: POST, PUT, DELETE

3. `src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/controller/UseCaseController.kt`
   - Controller: Changed to `@Secured(SecurityRule.IS_AUTHENTICATED)`
   - Added `@Secured("ADMIN", "CHAMPION", "REQ")` to: POST, PUT, DELETE

**Documentation (2 files)**:
4. `specs/014-add-champion-req-roles/spec.md` - Updated access control matrix
5. `specs/014-add-champion-req-roles/README.md` - Updated access control matrix

## Updated Access Control Matrix

| Feature | USER | ADMIN | VULN | RELEASE_MANAGER | CHAMPION | REQ |
|---------|------|-------|------|-----------------|----------|-----|
| **Requirements Overview** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Norm Management (View)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Norm Management (Edit)** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Standard Management (View)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Standard Management (Edit)** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **UseCase Management (View)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **UseCase Management (Edit)** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Key Change**: All users can now VIEW (GET) norms, standards, and use cases. Only ADMIN/CHAMPION/REQ can EDIT (POST/PUT/DELETE).

## Verification

### Backend Compilation
```bash
$ cd src/backendng && ./gradlew compileKotlin
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 23s
✅ No errors, only expected warnings
```

### Expected Behavior After Fix

**USER Role**:
- ✅ Can view Requirements Overview page
- ✅ Can see norms/standards/usecases in dropdowns
- ✅ Can create/edit/delete requirements
- ❌ Cannot create/edit/delete norms/standards/usecases (edit buttons hidden or return 403)

**CHAMPION/REQ Role**:
- ✅ Can view Requirements Overview page
- ✅ Can see norms/standards/usecases in dropdowns
- ✅ Can create/edit/delete requirements
- ✅ Can create/edit/delete norms/standards/usecases
- ✅ Sidebar shows Norm/Standard/UseCase Management menu items

**ADMIN Role**:
- ✅ Full access to everything

## Testing Recommendations

1. **USER Role Test**:
   - Login as user with only USER role
   - Navigate to /requirements
   - Verify page loads with requirements list
   - Verify dropdown filters work (norms, standards, use cases)
   - Verify cannot access /norms, /standards, /usecases management pages (should not see in sidebar)

2. **CHAMPION Role Test**:
   - Login as user with CHAMPION role
   - Navigate to /requirements - should work
   - Navigate to /norms - should work with edit capabilities
   - Navigate to /standards - should work with edit capabilities
   - Navigate to /usecases - should work with edit capabilities

3. **REQ Role Test**:
   - Same as CHAMPION role test

## Rollback
If issues persist:
```bash
# Revert the changes
git diff HEAD~1 src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/controller/
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/controller/NormController.kt
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/controller/StandardController.kt
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/controller/UseCaseController.kt
```

## Lessons Learned
- **Read vs Write permissions**: Controllers that serve reference data (norms, standards, use cases) need read access for all users
- **Method-level security**: More flexible than controller-level for mixed read/write scenarios
- **Testing with different roles**: Always test with least privileged role (USER) to catch access issues
