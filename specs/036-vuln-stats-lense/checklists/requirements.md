# Specification Quality Checklist: Vulnerability Statistics Lense

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

## Notes

- Specification is technology-agnostic and focuses on user value
- All 4 user stories are independently testable with clear priorities
- 15 functional requirements defined, all testable
- 8 success criteria defined with measurable metrics
- Edge cases comprehensively covered
- Dependencies and assumptions clearly documented
- Out of scope items explicitly listed
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and actionable
