## Architecture

### Data Model

#### RequirementSnapshot Entity
- **Purpose**: Immutable point-in-time copy of requirement state
- **Storage Strategy**: Denormalized (all fields copied, relationships stored as JSON arrays)
- **Key Fields**:
  - `originalRequirementId` (logical reference, not FK)
  - All requirement fields (shortreq, chapter, norm, details, etc.)
  - `usecaseIdsSnapshot`, `normIdsSnapshot` (JSON arrays)
  - `snapshotTimestamp`
- **Relationships**: ManyToOne to Release (cascade delete)
- **Indexes**: `release_id`, `original_requirement_id`

#### Release Entity
- **Purpose**: Container for requirement snapshots
- **Key Fields**:
  - `version` (semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
  - `name`, `description`
  - `status` (DRAFT, PUBLISHED, ARCHIVED)
  - `releaseDate`, `createdBy`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- **Relationships**: OneToMany to RequirementSnapshot (cascade delete)
- **Validation**: Unique version, semantic versioning format

### Backend Components

#### Domain Layer (`src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/domain/`)
- `Release.kt` - Release entity with status enum
- `RequirementSnapshot.kt` - Snapshot entity with factory method
- `User.kt` - Added RELEASE_MANAGER role to enum

#### Repository Layer (`src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/repository/`)
- `ReleaseRepository.kt` - CRUD operations for releases
- `RequirementSnapshotRepository.kt` - Snapshot queries with indexes

#### Service Layer (`src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/service/`)
- **ReleaseService.kt**:
  - `createRelease()` - Validates version, creates release, snapshots all requirements
  - `deleteRelease()` - Deletes release and cascade deletes snapshots

- **RequirementService.kt** (modified):
  - `deleteRequirement()` - Added deletion prevention check for frozen requirements

- **RequirementComparisonService.kt**:
  - `compare()` - Field-level diff algorithm with O(n) complexity
  - Returns categorized results: added, deleted, modified (with field changes), unchanged

#### Controller Layer (`src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/controller/`)
- **ReleaseController.kt**:
  - `POST /api/releases` - Create release (ADMIN, RELEASE_MANAGER)
  - `GET /api/releases` - List releases with optional status filter
  - `GET /api/releases/{id}` - Get release details
  - `DELETE /api/releases/{id}` - Delete release (ADMIN, RELEASE_MANAGER)
  - `GET /api/releases/{id}/requirements` - Get release snapshots

- **ReleaseComparisonController.kt**:
  - `GET /api/releases/compare?fromReleaseId=X&toReleaseId=Y` - Compare releases

- **RequirementController.kt** (modified):
  - Added `?releaseId=X` parameter to export endpoints (Excel, Word)
  - Maintains backward compatibility (no releaseId = current requirements)

#### DTOs (`src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/dto/`)
- `ComparisonResult.kt` - Comparison response structure
- `RequirementDiff.kt` - Modified requirement with field changes
- `FieldChange.kt` - Individual field diff (fieldName, oldValue, newValue)

  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Modified requirements (expandable field changes)
  - âšª Gray: Unchanged count
- Expandable modified items show field-level diff table
- Validation prevents comparing same release
- Info message when no changes found

**ReleaseManagement.tsx** (modified):
- Updated interface to match API response structure
- Changed status enum: ACTIVE â†’ PUBLISHED
- Added requirement count column with badge
- Fixed createdBy to expect string instead of object
- CRUD operations for releases (RELEASE_MANAGER only)

**Export.tsx** (modified):
- Integrated ReleaseSelector component

## API Endpoints

### Release Management
```http
POST   /api/releases                        Create release (ADMIN, RELEASE_MANAGER)
GET    /api/releases?status=PUBLISHED       List releases (authenticated)
GET    /api/releases/{id}                   Get release details (authenticated)
DELETE /api/releases/{id}                   Delete release (ADMIN, RELEASE_MANAGER)
GET    /api/releases/{id}/requirements      Get release snapshots (authenticated)
```

### Comparison
```http
GET    /api/releases/compare?fromReleaseId={id}&toReleaseId={id}
```

### Export (Extended)
```http
GET    /api/requirements/export/xlsx?releaseId={id}
GET    /api/requirements/export/docx?releaseId={id}
GET    /api/requirements/export/xlsx/translated/{lang}?releaseId={id}
GET    /api/requirements/export/docx/translated/{lang}?releaseId={id}
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Denormalized Snapshot Storage
**Decision**: Store all requirement fields in RequirementSnapshot, including relationships as JSON arrays
**Rationale**:
- Ensures immutability (snapshots unaffected by changes to original requirements)
- Allows deletion of original requirements without breaking historical data
- Simplifies queries (no joins needed to retrieve snapshot data)
- Trade-off: Storage overhead vs. query performance and data integrity

### 2. Logical vs. Foreign Key Reference
**Decision**: `originalRequirementId` is a logical reference (not FK with constraint)
**Rationale**:
- Allows deletion of original requirements while preserving snapshots
- Deletion prevention check uses snapshots as source of truth
- If requirement frozen in release, deletion blocked
- If requirement not frozen, deletion allowed (orphan snapshots acceptable)

### 3. Companion Object Factory Method
**Decision**: `RequirementSnapshot.fromRequirement()` companion object method
**Rationale**:
- Encapsulates snapshot creation logic
- Ensures consistent field copying
- Makes snapshot generation explicit and testable
- Kotlin idiomatic pattern

### 4. Field-Level Diff Algorithm
**Decision**: In-memory O(n) comparison algorithm
**Rationale**:
- Efficient for typical dataset sizes (< 10,000 requirements)
- Detailed field changes enable granular UI display
- No database queries during comparison (all data loaded once)
- Performance target: < 1 second for 1000 vs 1000

### 5. Backward-Compatible Export API
**Decision**: Optional `releaseId` query parameter on existing endpoints
**Rationale**:
- No breaking changes to existing clients
- Default behavior unchanged (current requirements)
- Release export is opt-in feature
- Single endpoint handles both use cases

### 6. RELEASE_MANAGER Role
**Decision**: New role separate from ADMIN
**Rationale**:
- Principle of least privilege
- Release management is specialized operation
- Allows delegation without granting full admin access
- ADMIN still has all permissions (includes RELEASE_MANAGER capabilities)

## Security Considerations

### Authorization
- Release creation/deletion: `@Secured("ADMIN", "RELEASE_MANAGER")`
- Release viewing: `@Secured(SecurityRule.IS_AUTHENTICATED)`
- Comparison: `@Secured(SecurityRule.IS_AUTHENTICATED)`
- Export: Existing permissions (authenticated users)

### Input Validation
- Semantic versioning regex: `^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$`
- Version uniqueness enforced at database level
- Name/description length limits (1-200 chars, 1-1000 chars)
- Comparison validates different release IDs

### Data Integrity
- Deletion prevention ensures requirements frozen in releases cannot be deleted
- Cascade delete ensures orphan snapshots removed when release deleted
- Indexes on `release_id` and `original_requirement_id` for query performance

## Migration Notes

### Database Changes
- New table: `release` (id, version, name, description, status, releaseDate, createdBy, createdAt, updatedAt)
- New table: `requirement_snapshot` (all requirement fields + release_id, original_requirement_id, snapshotTimestamp)
- Indexes: `idx_snapshot_release`, `idx_snapshot_original`
- Modified: `user` table enum (added RELEASE_MANAGER)

### Backward Compatibility
- âœ… Existing export endpoints work unchanged (no `releaseId` = current requirements)
- âœ… No changes to existing Requirement entity
- âœ… No changes to existing requirement CRUD operations (except deletion validation)
- âœ… Frontend components are additive (new pages/components only)

### Deployment Steps
1. Database migration (Hibernate auto-migration handles schema changes)
2. Backend deployment (no downtime - API additions only)
3. Frontend deployment (new routes and components)
4. Create RELEASE_MANAGER role for designated users via admin UI

## Known Limitations

1. **Snapshot Size**: Denormalized storage means ~2-3x disk space per release compared to normalized storage
   - Mitigation: Archive old releases, disk space is cheap

2. **Large Dataset Performance**: Comparison algorithm loads all snapshots into memory
   - Current target: 1000 vs 1000 requirements in < 1 second
   - Future: Consider pagination or streaming for > 10,000 requirements

3. **Relationship Changes**: Snapshots store relationship IDs as JSON arrays, not live references
   - If UseCase or Norm is deleted, snapshot still shows old ID
   - Future: Could snapshot relationship details (name, description) instead of just IDs

4. **No Release Editing**: Releases are create-only (no update endpoint)
   - Intentional design for immutability
   - Future: Could add metadata editing (name, description) without affecting snapshots

5. **No Partial Snapshots**: Release always snapshots ALL requirements
   - Future: Could add filtered snapshots (by chapter, norm, etc.)
