# Feature Specification: Release-Based Requirement Version Management

**Feature Branch**: `011-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i want to add the term 'Release' to secman. The release defines a date in time with defined requirement states / versions. Meaning if I create a new release the current requirements will be frozen in. If I dont specify a release for Export, always the most current requirement versions will be exported. I can add / delete releases. Please make a holistic planning for this feature."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: Release as version snapshot mechanism for requirements
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: System administrators (ADMIN), compliance managers (RELEASE_MANAGER), auditors (USER)
   ‚Üí Actions: Create release, freeze requirements, export with/without release
   ‚Üí Data: Requirements, releases, version snapshots
   ‚Üí Constraints: Current versions by default, historical via release selection
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens to existing requirements when updating after release?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Can requirements be deleted after being frozen in a release?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should releases be immutable once created?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows for release creation and exports
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Release, Requirement versions, Export configurations
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - marked clarification items
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: When should requirement snapshots be frozen into a release? ‚Üí A: Immediately when release is created (any status)
- Q: What should happen when a requirement is deleted after being frozen in one or more releases? ‚Üí A: Prevent deletion - requirements in releases cannot be deleted
- Q: Which user roles should have permission to create and delete releases? ‚Üí A: ADMIN and new RELEASE_MANAGER role
- Q: Should release version identifiers follow a specific format? ‚Üí A: Enforce semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0, 2.1.3)
- Q: Should requirement comparison across releases be an active system feature or handled through manual review of exports? ‚Üí A: Active feature - side-by-side comparison UI

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a **compliance manager with RELEASE_MANAGER permissions**, I need to create point-in-time snapshots of security requirements so that I can:
- Document exactly which requirements applied at a specific release date
- Export historical requirement versions for audit purposes
- Compare current requirements against past releases
- Ensure regulatory compliance evidence is preserved for historical periods

Without releases, I can only export the current state of requirements, making it impossible to prove what requirements were in effect during past audits or assessments.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** no release is specified for export, **When** I export requirements to Excel or Word, **Then** I receive the most current version of all requirements

2. **Given** I have multiple requirements in the system, **When** I create a new release (e.g., "Q4 2024 Compliance Review v1.0.0"), **Then** all current requirement versions are frozen and associated with that release

3. **Given** a release has been created with frozen requirements, **When** I update a requirement after the release, **Then** the release still contains the original frozen version AND the live system shows the updated version

4. **Given** I have multiple releases in the system, **When** I choose to export requirements for a specific release (e.g., "v1.0.0"), **Then** I receive the exact requirement versions that were active at that release date

5. **Given** I no longer need a release, **When** I delete the release, **Then** the frozen requirement versions associated with that release are removed BUT current requirements remain unaffected

6. **Given** I want to create a new release, **When** I specify the version number, name, and optional description, **Then** the system creates the release and captures a snapshot of all current requirement states

7. **Given** I am viewing the export options, **When** I select a release from a dropdown, **Then** the export includes only the requirement versions from that specific release

8. **Given** I want to audit historical compliance, **When** I use the comparison feature to select two releases (e.g., "1.0.0" and "1.1.0"), **Then** the system displays a side-by-side view highlighting which requirements were added, deleted, or modified between those releases

9. **Given** I am viewing a release comparison, **When** I review the differences, **Then** I see color-coded indicators for additions (green), deletions (red), and modifications (yellow) with detailed change information for modified requirements

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a requirement is deleted after being frozen in a release?
  - Expected: System prevents deletion and displays error message listing all releases containing the requirement. User must delete releases first before deleting the requirement.

- What happens when I create a release with no requirements in the system?
  - Expected: System should allow release creation but warn that no requirements will be frozen

- What happens when I try to create a release with a duplicate version number?
  - Expected: System should reject with validation error requiring unique version numbers

- What happens when I try to create a release with an invalid version format (e.g., "v1.0", "Q4-2024")?
  - Expected: System should reject with validation error requiring semantic versioning format (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

- What happens when I export a release that has been deleted?
  - Expected: Not applicable - deleted releases should not appear in export options

- What happens if I create multiple releases on the same day?
  - Expected: All releases should be independently maintained with their own frozen snapshots

- What happens when I update a requirement that exists in 5 different releases?
  - Expected: All 5 release snapshots remain unchanged; only the current "live" requirement is updated

- What happens when I want to restore a requirement to a previous release version?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should users be able to "rollback" current requirements to a release version, or is this read-only history?]

## Notes for Planning Phase

### Existing System Observations
Based on codebase analysis, the following infrastructure already exists:
- Release entity with version, name, description, status fields
- VersionedEntity base class that Requirement already extends
- Release repository with basic CRUD operations
- Release management UI component
- Export endpoints for requirements (Excel, Word, with use case filtering)

### Integration Points
The feature will need to integrate with:
- Existing requirement export functionality (RequirementController lines 349-441, 609-927)
- Release management UI (ReleaseManagement.tsx)
- Requirement management screens to show version history
- Authentication/authorization for permission checks

### Business Value
This feature enables:
1. **Compliance Evidence**: Prove which requirements applied during specific audit periods
2. **Change Tracking**: Document requirement evolution over time
3. **Regulatory Reporting**: Export historical requirement states for regulatory submissions
4. **Risk Management**: Compare current vs. past requirements to identify gaps
5. **Version Control**: Professional requirement lifecycle management similar to software releases

### Success Metrics
- Number of releases created per quarter
- Frequency of historical exports vs. current exports
- Time saved in audit preparation (baseline vs. post-implementation)
- User satisfaction with release management workflow
- Reduction in compliance documentation errors
