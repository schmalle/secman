# Specification Quality Checklist: Outdated Assets View

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
**Status**: ✅ PASS

- Specification is written in business-focused language without technical implementation details
- All sections focus on user value: what users need and why
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
**Status**: ✅ PASS

- All 20 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present (all decisions made with reasonable defaults)
- Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., "under 2 seconds", "10,000 assets", "99.9% uptime")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of specific databases, frameworks, or tools)
- Acceptance scenarios follow proper Given-When-Then format
- 7 edge cases identified covering boundary conditions and error scenarios
- Scope clearly defined with "Out of Scope" section
- Dependencies, assumptions, and constraints all documented

### Feature Readiness Assessment
**Status**: ✅ PASS

- Each of the 5 user stories has clear acceptance scenarios (28 total scenarios)
- User stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) with rationale
- Each user story is independently testable
- 8 success criteria defined with measurable outcomes
- No implementation details found in specification (verified: no mentions of databases, programming languages, frameworks, or specific technologies)

## Notes

- **Specification Quality**: Excellent - no issues found
- **Readiness**: Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`
- **Strengths**:
  - Comprehensive user scenarios with clear priorities
  - Well-defined performance requirements (2 second load, 30 second refresh, 10,000+ assets)
  - Clear RBAC and workgroup access control requirements
  - Detailed edge case coverage
  - Technology-agnostic throughout

- **Recommendations for Planning Phase**:
  - Consider phasing implementation: P1 stories first (core view + details), then P2 (refresh + access control), finally P3 (filtering/search)
  - Materialized view refresh strategy will be critical for performance - should be early architectural decision
  - Consider impact on existing CLI import service - integration point needs careful design
