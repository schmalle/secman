# Tasks: Release Management UI Enhancement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/012-build-ui-for/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ

**Tests**: E2E tests with Playwright are included as this is a TDD-driven feature per constitutional requirement.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `src/frontend/src/` for components/pages, `src/frontend/tests/e2e/` for tests
- Frontend-only feature - no backend changes needed

---

## Phase 0: Foundation (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Set up service layer, test infrastructure, and shared utilities

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: These tasks must be complete before user story implementation begins

- [ ] T001 [P] Create release service API wrapper in src/frontend/src/services/releaseService.ts
- [ ] T002 [P] Create Playwright test helpers in src/frontend/tests/e2e/helpers/releaseHelpers.ts
- [ ] T003 [P] Add exceljs dependency to src/frontend/package.json for client-side comparison export
- [ ] T004 Verify authenticatedFetch utility works with release endpoints (manual test)
- [ ] T005 Document backend endpoint status (comparison export missing, status update endpoint verification)

**Validation**: 
- releaseService methods compile without errors
- Test helpers can create/delete test releases
- exceljs imports successfully

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Foundation (Phase 0)**: No dependencies - must complete before all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 1 - P1)**: Depends on Foundation - BLOCKS MVP
- **User Story 2 (Phase 2 - P1)**: Depends on Foundation - BLOCKS MVP
  - **After Phase 2: MVP COMPLETE** üéâ
- **User Story 3 (Phase 3 - P2)**: Depends on Foundation - can start after Phase 0
- **User Story 4 (Phase 4 - P2)**: Depends on Foundation - can start after Phase 0
- **User Story 5 (Phase 5 - P2)**: Depends on Foundation + User Story 1 (needs ReleaseList) - can work in parallel with US3/US4
- **User Story 7 (Phase 6 - P2)**: Depends on Foundation - can start after Phase 0
- **User Story 6 (Phase 7 - P3)**: Depends on Foundation + User Story 1 (needs ReleaseList) - can work in parallel with others
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories complete

### User Story Independence

All user stories are independently testable after Foundation is complete:
- **US1 (Browse)**: Independent - just needs service layer
- **US2 (Create)**: Independent - just needs service layer
- **US3 (Detail)**: Independent - just needs service layer + routing
- **US4 (Compare)**: Independent - just needs service layer
- **US5 (Status)**: Requires US1 (ReleaseList component exists)
- **US6 (Delete)**: Requires US1 (ReleaseList component exists)
- **US7 (Export)**: Independent - just needs ReleaseSelector

### Parallel Opportunities

**Foundation (Phase 0)**: All 5 tasks can run in parallel (T001-T005)

**Within Each User Story**:
- All E2E tests can be written in parallel (marked [P])
- Component creation can happen in parallel if different files (marked [P])

**Across User Stories** (after Foundation):
- US1, US2, US3, US4, US7 can all be developed in parallel by different developers
- US5 and US6 can start once US1 (ReleaseList) is created

### Example Parallel Execution

**Day 1 (Foundation)**:
```
Parallel: T001, T002, T003, T004, T005
```

**Days 2-4 (MVP - if team of 2)**:
```
Developer A: US1 (T006-T016)
Developer B: US2 (T017-T028)
```

**Days 5-8 (P2 features - if team of 3)**:
```
Developer A: US3 (T029-T038)
Developer B: US4 (T039-T050)
Developer C: US7 (T064-T073)
Then US5 (T051-T063) and US6 (T074-T086)
```

## Critical Path

The critical path to MVP (Phase 2 complete):

```
Phase 0 (Foundation) ‚Üí Phase 1 (US1 - List) ‚Üí Phase 2 (US2 - Create)
    5 tasks         ‚Üí      11 tasks         ‚Üí      12 tasks
    (Day 1)         ‚Üí    (Days 2-3)         ‚Üí    (Days 3-4)

= MVP: 28 tasks over 4 days
```

After MVP, all P2 features can be developed in parallel if team capacity allows.

## Notes

- **TDD Approach**: All E2E tests are written FIRST before implementation (marked with ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE)
- **[P] Marker**: Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel with others in the same phase
- **[Story] Marker**: Tasks marked [US#] belong to specific user story for traceability
- **Exact File Paths**: All file paths are explicit for clarity
- **Checkpoints**: Each user story phase has a checkpoint to validate independent functionality
- **MVP Milestone**: After Phase 2 (T028), feature can be demoed with browse + create functionality

**Ready to start**: Begin with T001 (create releaseService.ts) and proceed sequentially through Foundation, then move to MVP user stories.
