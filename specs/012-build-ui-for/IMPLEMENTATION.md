**Tasks**: 13 total (7 tests + 6 implementation)  
**Status**: Implementation complete, testing in progress  
**Priority**: P3

#### Completed Tasks

**Tests (TDD - Written First)** âœ…:

## Next Steps: Validation & Testing

**Immediate**:
1. Run E2E tests to verify all scenarios pass
2. Test RBAC enforcement manually
3. Verify toast notifications display correctly
