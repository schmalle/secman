## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: Should the system support single-tenant, multi-tenant, or both authentication modes for Microsoft identity provider? ‚Üí A: Single-tenant only (tenant ID required, one organization per provider)
- Q: How should the system map Azure AD user groups/roles to application roles? ‚Üí A: No role mapping - all Microsoft users get default role (defer advanced mapping to future feature)
- Q: What should happen when a Microsoft user has no email address in their profile? ‚Üí A: Reject authentication - display error if email is missing from Microsoft profile
- Q: What validations should the provider configuration test endpoint perform? ‚Üí A: Basic validation only - check required fields and URL formats
- Q: What default role should be assigned to auto-provisioned Microsoft users? ‚Üí A: USER role (hardcoded) - all auto-provisioned Microsoft users get USER role

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I need to configure Microsoft (Azure AD/Entra ID) as an identity provider for my organization's tenant so that employees can authenticate using their existing Microsoft work or school accounts, eliminating the need for separate credentials and enabling centralized identity management.

As an end user, I want to sign in with my Microsoft account so that I can access the application using my existing corporate credentials without creating a new password.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an administrator has valid Microsoft OAuth application credentials (client ID, client secret, and tenant ID), **When** they configure a new Microsoft identity provider through the admin interface, **Then** the system should save the configuration and allow users from that specific tenant to authenticate via Microsoft.

2. **Given** a Microsoft identity provider is enabled with auto-provisioning, **When** a new user from the configured tenant authenticates for the first time, **Then** the system should automatically create a user account with information from their Microsoft profile (email, name, username) and assign the USER role.

3. **Given** a user clicks "Sign in with Microsoft" on the login page, **When** they complete Microsoft authentication successfully, **Then** they should be redirected back to the application and logged in with a valid session.

4. **Given** an organization has configured a Microsoft provider for a specific tenant, **When** a user from a different Azure AD tenant attempts to authenticate, **Then** the authentication should be rejected with an error message indicating tenant mismatch.

5. **Given** a Microsoft user successfully authenticates, **When** their account is auto-provisioned, **Then** the system should assign them the USER role by default (no role mapping from Azure AD groups or claims).

6. **Given** a Microsoft identity provider configuration has expired credentials, **When** a user attempts to authenticate, **Then** the system should display a clear error message and log the failure for administrator review.

7. **Given** Microsoft's authorization endpoint returns an error (e.g., user denied consent), **When** the OAuth callback is processed, **Then** the user should be redirected to the login page with a human-readable error message.

8. **Given** an administrator wants to test the Microsoft provider configuration, **When** they click the "Test" button in the identity provider management interface, **Then** the system should validate that all required fields are present and URLs are properly formatted without requiring a full authentication flow.

9. **Given** a Microsoft user profile does not include an email address, **When** they attempt to authenticate, **Then** the authentication should fail with an error message: "Email address required for account creation."

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Microsoft returns claims in different formats or structures than expected?
- Authentication must fail with clear error message when Microsoft user has no email address in their profile (email is required).
- What happens if the discovery URL endpoint is unreachable or returns malformed data?
- How does the system handle concurrent authentication attempts with the same state token?
- What happens when a Microsoft token exchange fails due to network issues or timeouts?
- How does the system handle Microsoft-specific error codes (e.g., AADSTS errors)?
- What happens when a user's Microsoft account email changes between authentication sessions?
- How does the system validate tenant ID matches between configuration and authentication response?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Configuration Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow administrators to configure Microsoft as an identity provider with client ID, client secret, and tenant ID (all fields required).
- **FR-002**: System MUST support single-tenant authentication only, using tenant-specific endpoints (format: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}/v2.0/`) and rejecting users from other tenants.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a template or wizard for Microsoft configuration that pre-fills standard Microsoft OAuth endpoint patterns and prompts for tenant ID.
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate Microsoft provider configuration before enabling it for user authentication.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow administrators to specify which Microsoft API scopes to request (e.g., openid, email, profile).
- **FR-006**: System MUST securely store Microsoft client secrets with encryption at rest.

#### Authentication Flow Requirements
- **FR-007**: System MUST redirect users to Microsoft's tenant-specific authorization endpoint when they select "Sign in with Microsoft".
- **FR-008**: System MUST include a unique state parameter in OAuth requests to prevent CSRF attacks.
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate the state parameter when processing the OAuth callback.
- **FR-010**: System MUST exchange the authorization code for an access token using Microsoft's tenant-specific token endpoint.
- **FR-011**: System MUST retrieve user profile information from Microsoft's UserInfo endpoint or Microsoft Graph API.
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle Microsoft-specific error responses and display appropriate user-friendly messages.
- **FR-013**: System MUST respect state token expiration (currently 10 minutes) and reject expired authentication attempts.
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate that the authenticated user's tenant ID matches the configured tenant ID and reject authentication if there is a mismatch.

#### User Provisioning Requirements
- **FR-015**: System MUST support automatic user provisioning when auto-provision is enabled for the Microsoft provider.
- **FR-016**: System MUST extract user email, name, and username from Microsoft claims during authentication.
- **FR-017**: System MUST reject authentication and display error message "Email address required for account creation" when Microsoft user profile does not contain an email address.
- **FR-018**: System MUST find existing users by email address before creating new accounts to prevent duplicates.
- **FR-019**: System MUST assign USER role to all auto-provisioned Microsoft users (hardcoded, not configurable).

#### Claim and Role Mapping Requirements
- **FR-020**: System MUST extract basic profile claims (email, name, username) from Microsoft authentication response for user provisioning.
- **FR-021**: System MUST NOT implement Azure AD group or role mapping in this feature (deferred to future enhancement).

#### Discovery and Endpoint Management
- **FR-022**: System MUST support OpenID Connect discovery to automatically fetch Microsoft endpoint URLs from the tenant-specific well-known configuration endpoint.
- **FR-023**: System MUST fall back to manually configured endpoints if discovery fails or is not configured.
- **FR-024**: System MUST construct tenant-specific endpoint URLs using the configured tenant ID (e.g., authorization, token, userinfo endpoints).

#### Security and Error Handling
- **FR-025**: System MUST log all Microsoft authentication attempts (success and failure) for security auditing.
- **FR-026**: System MUST automatically clean up expired OAuth state tokens to prevent database bloat.
- **FR-027**: System MUST handle network timeouts when communicating with Microsoft endpoints gracefully.
- **FR-028**: System MUST display specific, actionable error messages for common Microsoft error codes (AADSTS errors).
- **FR-029**: System MUST prevent OAuth state token reuse by deleting tokens after successful authentication.
- **FR-030**: System MUST display tenant mismatch errors when users from incorrect Azure AD tenants attempt to authenticate.

#### Testing and Validation
- **FR-031**: System MUST provide a test function that performs basic validation: checking that required fields (client ID, client secret, tenant ID) are present and that URL formats are valid.
- **FR-032**: System MUST provide clear feedback when Microsoft provider configuration is incomplete or invalid.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **IdentityProvider**: Represents a configured identity provider (Microsoft). Contains provider type (OIDC), tenant ID (required for single-tenant), client credentials, endpoint URLs, scopes, enabled status, auto-provisioning settings, and button customization. Role mapping and claim mapping fields are present but not actively used in this feature version.

- **OAuthState**: Represents a temporary OAuth state token used for CSRF protection. Contains state token (unique identifier), provider ID reference, redirect URI, creation timestamp, and expiration timestamp (default 10 minutes).

- **User**: Represents an authenticated user account. Contains username, email (required), password hash (random for OAuth users), roles (always USER for auto-provisioned Microsoft users in this version), workgroup memberships, and audit timestamps. Email is used as the primary identifier for matching Microsoft users to existing accounts.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Existing Capabilities
The current implementation provides:
- Generic OAuth 2.0 / OIDC provider support through the `IdentityProvider` entity
- Frontend template for Microsoft with discovery URL pre-filled
- OAuth authorization flow with state validation
- Token exchange mechanism
- User info retrieval and auto-provisioning
- Provider management UI with test functionality

### Identified Gaps

1. **Tenant Configuration**: No explicit support for single-tenant configuration. The frontend template uses `/common/v2.0/` endpoint, which needs to be replaced with tenant-specific endpoints.

2. **Discovery Implementation**: While `discoveryUrl` field exists, there's no implementation that fetches and caches endpoint configuration from the discovery URL.

3. **Email Validation**: No explicit validation that rejects authentication when email claim is missing from Microsoft response.

4. **Microsoft-Specific Error Handling**: Generic OAuth error handling exists, but Microsoft-specific AADSTS error codes are not parsed or translated to user-friendly messages.

5. **Provider Test Functionality**: Frontend calls `/api/identity-providers/{id}/test` endpoint which doesn't exist in the backend implementation.

6. **Scope Validation**: No validation that requested scopes are compatible with Microsoft's API or that essential scopes (openid, email) are included.

7. **Tenant Validation**: No validation that authenticated user's tenant matches the configured tenant ID.

8. **Role Assignment**: No explicit hardcoded assignment of USER role during auto-provisioning (currently relies on default user creation logic).

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Tenant-Aware Configuration**: Add tenant ID field to IdentityProvider entity and update endpoint URL construction to use tenant-specific paths.

2. **Discovery Automation**: Implement automatic endpoint discovery using the tenant-specific OpenID Connect discovery document to reduce configuration burden.

3. **Enhanced Error Messages**: Map AADSTS error codes to human-readable messages with actionable guidance.

4. **Configuration Validation**: Implement the missing test endpoint to validate required fields and URL formats.

5. **Email Requirement Enforcement**: Add explicit validation that email claim exists in Microsoft response before proceeding with user provisioning.

6. **Tenant Mismatch Detection**: Validate tenant ID (tid claim) in Microsoft response matches configured tenant ID.

7. **Provider Initialization**: Extend `ProviderInitializationService` to auto-create Microsoft provider template similar to GitHub (with prompt for tenant ID).

8. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics and logging specific to Microsoft authentication flow to identify bottlenecks.

### Out of Scope (Deferred to Future)

The following capabilities were considered but explicitly deferred to future features:
- **Azure AD Group Mapping**: Extracting and mapping Azure AD group memberships to application roles
- **Custom Claim Mapping**: Processing custom claims or role claims from Azure AD
- **Microsoft Graph Integration**: Using Microsoft Graph API for enhanced user profile data
- **Configurable Default Roles**: Allowing admins to set default role per provider (always USER in this version)
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Supporting `/common` endpoint and allowing users from any tenant
- **B2B Guest User Support**: Special handling for Azure AD B2B guest users
- **Token Caching**: Caching Microsoft access tokens for future API calls
- **Refresh Token Support**: Storing and using refresh tokens for long-lived sessions
