# Specification Quality Checklist: Last Admin Protection

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS**: Specification contains no technical implementation details (no mention of Kotlin, Micronaut, database specifics, or API implementation details).

✅ **PASS**: Focused entirely on business value - preventing system lockout and maintaining administrative access.

✅ **PASS**: Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders. Uses clear user stories with business justifications.

✅ **PASS**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS**: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are concrete and actionable.

✅ **PASS**: All requirements are testable. Each FR includes specific, verifiable behaviors (e.g., "prevent deletion", "display error message", "validate before deletion").

✅ **PASS**: Success criteria include specific measurable metrics:
- SC-001: 100% blocking rate
- SC-002: 1 second response time
- SC-003: Zero-admin state prevention
- SC-005: 2 second validation time for 100 users

✅ **PASS**: Success criteria are completely technology-agnostic. They describe outcomes (blocking deletions, displaying messages, maintaining state) without mentioning implementation technologies.

✅ **PASS**: All three user stories include detailed acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format with multiple test cases per story.

✅ **PASS**: Edge cases section addresses:
- Multi-role users
- Concurrent deletion attempts
- Bulk operations
- Direct database manipulation
- Deactivation/suspension scenarios

✅ **PASS**: Scope is clearly bounded to deletion and role-removal protection for ADMIN users. Explicitly addresses what's in scope (UI, API, bulk operations) and acknowledges database-level operations are out of scope.

✅ **PASS**: Dependencies on existing User entity and Role system are identified. Edge cases include assumptions about transaction isolation and optimistic locking.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS**: Each functional requirement maps to specific acceptance scenarios in the user stories. FR-001 to FR-010 are all covered by the three prioritized user stories.

✅ **PASS**: Three user stories cover:
- P1: Core deletion blocking (critical flow)
- P2: User feedback and error handling (user experience)
- P3: Role change protection (complete coverage)

✅ **PASS**: All success criteria align with feature goals:
- SC-001-003 validate core protection mechanism
- SC-004 ensures normal operations aren't disrupted
- SC-005 validates performance for bulk operations

✅ **PASS**: No implementation leakage detected. Specification stays focused on what and why, never on how.

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Technology-agnostic and implementation-neutral
- Testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Scoped appropriately with edge cases addressed
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.implement`

## Notes

This is a well-scoped safety feature with clear boundaries. The specification correctly identifies the core requirement (prevent zero-admin state) and extends it logically to role changes. Edge cases are thoughtfully addressed, including concurrent operations and bulk deletions.

The three-priority structure allows for incremental delivery:
- P1 delivers minimum viable protection
- P2 adds essential user experience
- P3 completes the protection surface

No clarifications or spec updates required.
