# Quickstart: Nmap Scan Import Feature

**Feature**: 002-implement-a-parsing
**Purpose**: Manual testing and validation guide
**Prerequisite**: Implementation complete, Docker environment running

## Overview

This guide walks through the complete nmap scan import workflow from upload to viewing port history. Follow these steps after implementing all tasks to verify the feature works end-to-end.

---

## Setup

### 1. Start Development Environment

```bash
cd /Users/flake/sources/misc/secman
./docker/scripts/dev.sh up -d
```

**Verify**:
- Frontend: http://localhost:4321
- Backend: http://localhost:8080/health
- Database: `mysql -h localhost -u secman -pCHANGEME secman`

### 2. Prepare Test Data

Use the existing nmap test file:
```bash
ls -lh testdata/nmap.xml
# Should show: testdata/nmap.xml (single host: www.heise.de with ports 80, 443)
```

### 3. Login as Admin

- Navigate to http://localhost:4321
- Login: `adminuser` / `password`
- Verify ADMIN role: Check sidebar shows "Scans" entry

## Test Scenario 1: Upload Nmap Scan

### Steps

1. **Navigate to Import page**
   - Click "Import" in sidebar
   - Verify page loads with file upload interface

2. **Upload nmap file**
   - Click "Browse Files" or drag testdata/nmap.xml
   - Verify file name appears: "nmap.xml"
   - Click "Upload and Process Requirements" button
   - Wait for processing (should complete <5s for single host)

3. **Verify upload success**
   - Success message appears: "Scan uploaded and processed successfully"
   - Summary shows:
     - Hosts discovered: 1
     - Assets created/updated: 1
     - Total ports: 2 (or 3 depending on closed ports)

**Expected Database State**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM scan ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;
-- Should show: scan_type='nmap', host_count=1, uploaded_by='adminuser'

SELECT * FROM scan_result WHERE scan_id = <scan_id>;
-- Should show: ip_address='193.99.144.85', hostname='www.heise.de'

SELECT * FROM scan_port WHERE scan_result_id = <result_id>;
-- Should show: port 80 (state=open), port 443 (state=open)

SELECT * FROM asset WHERE ip = '193.99.144.85';
-- Should show: name='www.heise.de', type='Network Host', owner='adminuser'
```

## Test Scenario 2: View Scan History (Admin)

### Steps

1. **Navigate to Scans page**
   - Click "Scans" in sidebar
   - Verify page loads (admin-only access)

2. **Verify scan appears in list**
   - Table shows uploaded scan
   - Columns display:
     - Scan date: 2025-10-03 08:33:50 (from XML)
     - Filename: nmap.xml
     - Type: nmap
     - Hosts: 1
     - Duration: ~159 seconds
     - Uploaded by: adminuser

3. **View scan details**
   - Click scan row or "View Details" button
   - Detail view shows:
     - Scan metadata (same as list)
     - Host list table:
       - IP: 193.99.144.85
       - Hostname: www.heise.de
       - Asset link: clickable to asset page
       - Open ports: 2 (or 3)

**Expected API Response** (`GET /api/scans`):
```json
{
  "scans": [{
    "id": 1,
    "scanType": "nmap",
    "filename": "nmap.xml",
    "scanDate": "2025-10-03T08:33:50Z",
    "uploadedBy": "adminuser",
    "hostCount": 1,
    "duration": 159,
    "createdAt": "2025-10-03T..."
  }],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 0,
    "size": 20,
    "totalElements": 1,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
}
```

## Test Scenario 3: View Port History (All Users)

### Steps

1. **Navigate to Asset Management**
   - Click "Asset Management" in sidebar
   - Verify asset list loads

2. **Find scanned asset**
   - Locate asset "www.heise.de" (or 193.99.144.85)
   - Verify "Show open ports" button appears (enabled)

3. **View port history**
   - Click "Show open ports" button
   - Modal/panel opens showing port scan timeline
   - Displays:
     - Scan date: 2025-10-03 08:33:50
     - Scan type: nmap
     - Port list:
       - Port 80/tcp - open - http
       - Port 443/tcp - open - https

**Expected API Response** (`GET /api/assets/{id}/ports`):
```json
{
  "assetId": 1,
  "assetName": "www.heise.de",
  "ipAddress": "193.99.144.85",
  "scanHistory": [{
    "scanId": 1,
    "scanDate": "2025-10-03T08:33:50Z",
    "scanType": "nmap",
    "hostname": "www.heise.de",
    "ports": [
      {
        "portNumber": 80,
        "protocol": "tcp",
        "state": "open",
        "service": "http",
        "version": "nginx"
      },
      {
        "portNumber": 443,
        "protocol": "tcp",
        "state": "open",
        "service": "https",
        "version": null
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

## Test Scenario 4: Multiple Scans Over Time

### Steps

1. **Create second nmap scan**
   ```bash
   # Simulate scanning same host later (manually edit nmap.xml scan date if needed)
   # Or use a different nmap file from your archives
   ```

2. **Upload second scan**
   - Navigate to Import page
   - Upload modified/new nmap.xml
   - Verify upload success

3. **Verify scan history accumulates**
   - Go to Scans page (admin)
   - Verify 2 scans listed
   - Go to asset page
   - Click "Show open ports"
   - Verify 2 scan results in timeline (chronological order)

**Expected Behavior**:
- Asset count stays at 1 (same IP reused)
- ScanResult count increases to 2
- Port history shows timeline of changes

---

## Test Scenario 5: RBAC Enforcement

### Steps

1. **Logout and login as normal user**
   - Logout adminuser
   - Login as `normaluser` / `password`

2. **Verify Scans page hidden**
   - Check sidebar: "Scans" entry should NOT appear
   - Direct navigation to /scans should redirect or show 403

3. **Verify port view still accessible**
   - Navigate to Asset Management
   - Find scanned asset
   - Click "Show open ports"
   - Verify port history loads (authenticated users allowed)

**Expected Behavior**:
- Admin-only pages return 403 for normal users
- Asset port view works for all authenticated users

---

## Test Scenario 6: Error Handling

### Steps

1. **Test invalid file upload**
   - Try uploading non-XML file (e.g., .txt)
   - Verify error: "File is not valid XML"

2. **Test malformed XML**
   - Create file with invalid XML syntax
   - Verify error: "XML parsing failed"

3. **Test empty scan**
   - Upload nmap XML with no hosts
   - Verify success with hostCount=0

4. **Test large file**
   - Upload 50MB+ file
   - Verify error: "File too large"

---

## Validation Checklist

After running all scenarios, verify:

- [x] Nmap XML upload works
- [x] Assets created with correct name/type/IP
- [x] Scan metadata stored correctly
- [x] Port data parsed and stored
- [x] Scans page shows scan history (admin-only)
- [x] Asset page shows "Show open ports" button
- [x] Port history displays chronologically
- [x] Multiple scans of same host tracked separately
- [x] RBAC enforced (admin vs normal user)
- [x] Error handling works (invalid files, large files)
- [x] Database foreign keys prevent orphaned data
- [x] API responses match contract schemas

---

## Database Cleanup (After Testing)

```sql
-- Remove test data
DELETE FROM scan_port WHERE scan_result_id IN (SELECT id FROM scan_result);
DELETE FROM scan_result WHERE scan_id IN (SELECT id FROM scan);
DELETE FROM scan;
DELETE FROM asset WHERE owner = 'adminuser' AND type = 'Network Host';
```

---

## Performance Benchmarks

Test with larger files to verify performance goals:

```bash
# Generate large nmap file (1000 hosts)
nmap -sS -oX /tmp/large-scan.xml 192.168.1.0/24

# Upload and time
time curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/scan/upload-nmap \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "file=@/tmp/large-scan.xml"

# Verify: Should complete in <30s for 1000 hosts
```

1. All 6 test scenarios pass
2. All validation checklist items checked
3. Performance benchmarks met
4. No errors in backend logs
5. Frontend renders without console errors
