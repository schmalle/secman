- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Details

### Content Quality Review
✅ **No implementation details**: Spec focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW. Uses technology-agnostic language (Excel file, button, sidebar navigation) without mentioning React, Kotlin, Micronaut, etc.

✅ **User value focused**: Each user story clearly articulates the business value (efficient cleanup, data portability, system restoration, improved navigation).

✅ **Non-technical language**: Accessible to product managers, business stakeholders. Technical details reserved for Dependencies section.

✅ **All mandatory sections**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Edge Cases, Key Entities, Assumptions, Dependencies all present and complete.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **No clarification markers**: All requirements are fully specified with reasonable defaults based on existing system patterns.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-001: "visible only to ADMIN" is testable by login as non-ADMIN and verifying button absence).

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC have specific metrics (30 seconds for bulk delete, 15 seconds for export, 95%+ success rate, 100% data integrity).

✅ **Technology-agnostic SC**: Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes (delete time, export time, data integrity) without mentioning database operations, API response times, or framework-specific metrics.

✅ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: 5 user stories with 5 acceptance scenarios each (25 total), covering happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 10 edge cases covering concurrency, data validation, error handling, format compatibility, and access control.

✅ **Clear scope**: Feature bounded to bulk delete, import/export with sidebar navigation. Explicitly excludes real-time asset monitoring, advanced filtering during export, or versioning of export files.

✅ **Dependencies documented**: 7 dependencies on existing features (workgroup access control, authentication utilities, Asset entity structure, import/export patterns, sidebar component, repository methods, file upload infrastructure).

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **Acceptance criteria coverage**: Each FR maps to one or more acceptance scenarios in user stories. For example:
  - FR-001 (Delete All Assets button) → US1 Scenario 2 (non-ADMIN visibility)
  - FR-009 (Export format) → US2 Scenario 2 (field columns)
  - FR-016 (Import validation) → US3 Scenario 3 (invalid data handling)

✅ **Primary flow coverage**: User stories cover:
  1. P1 - Bulk delete (core request)
  2. P1 - Export (data backup)
  3. P2 - Import (data restoration)
  4. P2 - Navigation (discoverability)
  5. P3 - End-to-end workflow (integration validation)

✅ **Measurable outcomes**: 8 success criteria covering performance (SC-001, SC-002, SC-003), data integrity (SC-004), security (SC-005), validation (SC-006), UX (SC-007), and reliability (SC-008).

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Spec maintains abstraction throughout. Even Dependencies section lists existing features/utilities without specifying implementation approaches for new code.

## Notes

- Spec is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements based on existing system patterns (Feature 008 workgroups, Feature 013/016 import patterns)
- Assumptions section documents 10 reasonable defaults to avoid unnecessary clarifications
- Success criteria include both quantitative (time, percentage) and qualitative (data integrity, error handling) measures
- Edge cases prioritize common failure scenarios (concurrency, validation, access control) that must be addressed in implementation
