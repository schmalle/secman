# Feature Specification: Role-Based Access Control - RISK, REQ, and SECCHAMPION Roles

**Feature Branch**: `025-role-based-access-control`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i want to have two roles added RISK and REQ, only users with ROLE ADMIN or RISK are allowed to see and access the Risk Management and its sub items. Additionally onle users with ROLE ADMIN or REQ are allowed to access Requirements item and its sub folders. Ensure the Readme.md is also updated accordingly. Also add a ROLE SECCHAMPION, this role also enbles access to Risk Management and Requirements and Vulnerabilities BUT not to the Admin area. Please also document this in Readme.MD."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-18

- Q: Should the system log role-based access control decisions (both grants and denials) for security audit purposes? → A: Log denials only with full context (user ID, roles, attempted resource, timestamp)
- Q: What specific information should permission denial error messages display to users? → A: Display generic message with contact support (e.g., "You don't have permission to access this resource. Contact your administrator.")
- Q: When should role assignment changes take effect for already logged-in users? → A: Immediate on next API request - role check happens on every request, no caching, changes apply to next user action

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Risk Manager Accessing Risk Management (Priority: P1)

A user with the RISK role needs to access the Risk Management section to create, view, edit, and manage risk assessments without needing full admin privileges.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality requested - enabling dedicated risk managers to do their job without requiring admin access. This is the minimum viable feature.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning a user the RISK role, logging in, and verifying they can access Risk Management and all its sub-items (create risk, view risks, edit assessments) while being denied access to other protected areas like Requirements and Admin.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with RISK role is logged in, **When** they navigate to the Risk Management menu, **Then** they see the Risk Management option and can click it to access all risk-related features
2. **Given** a user with RISK role is logged in, **When** they attempt to access the Requirements section, **Then** they are denied access with a generic permission error message directing them to contact their administrator
3. **Given** a user with RISK role is logged in, **When** they attempt to access the Admin area, **Then** they are denied access with a generic permission error message directing them to contact their administrator
4. **Given** an ADMIN user is logged in, **When** they navigate to Risk Management, **Then** they have full access (ADMIN retains all existing permissions)

### User Story 2 - Requirements Manager Accessing Requirements (Priority: P1)

A user with the REQ role needs to access the Requirements section to manage requirements, norms, and use cases without needing full admin privileges.

**Why this priority**: This is equally critical as Story 1 - enabling dedicated requirements managers to perform their specialized role without admin access. Essential for MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning a user the REQ role, logging in, and verifying they can access Requirements and all its sub-folders (view requirements, create/edit norms, manage use cases) while being denied access to Risk Management and Admin.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with REQ role is logged in, **When** they navigate to the Requirements menu, **Then** they see the Requirements option and can access all requirements-related features
2. **Given** a user with REQ role is logged in, **When** they attempt to access the Risk Management section, **Then** they are denied access with a generic permission error message directing them to contact their administrator
3. **Given** a user with REQ role is logged in, **When** they attempt to access the Admin area, **Then** they are denied access with a generic permission error message directing them to contact their administrator
4. **Given** an ADMIN user is logged in, **When** they navigate to Requirements, **Then** they have full access (ADMIN retains all existing permissions)

### User Story 3 - Security Champion Accessing Multiple Protected Areas (Priority: P2)

A user with the SECCHAMPION role needs broad access to Risk Management, Requirements, and Vulnerabilities to coordinate security efforts across the organization, but should not have admin capabilities.

**Why this priority**: This is a specialized "power user" role that combines access across multiple domains. It's important but not essential for initial MVP - can be added after individual RISK and REQ roles are working.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning a user the SECCHAMPION role, logging in, and verifying they can access Risk Management, Requirements, and Vulnerabilities sections while being explicitly denied access to Admin area.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with SECCHAMPION role is logged in, **When** they navigate the application, **Then** they see Risk Management, Requirements, and Vulnerabilities menu items
2. **Given** a user with SECCHAMPION role is logged in, **When** they access Risk Management, **Then** they have full access to create/view/edit risks
3. **Given** a user with SECCHAMPION role is logged in, **When** they access Requirements, **Then** they have full access to view/manage requirements and related items
4. **Given** a user with SECCHAMPION role is logged in, **When** they access Vulnerabilities, **Then** they have full access to view/manage vulnerability data
5. **Given** a user with SECCHAMPION role is logged in, **When** they attempt to access Admin area, **Then** they are denied access with a generic permission error message directing them to contact their administrator
6. **Given** a user with SECCHAMPION role is logged in, **When** they attempt admin-only operations (user management, system settings, workgroup management), **Then** they are denied with generic permission error messages directing them to contact their administrator

### User Story 4 - Admin Assigning Roles to Users (Priority: P2)

An administrator needs to assign RISK, REQ, or SECCHAMPION roles to users through the user management interface.

**Why this priority**: Necessary for the feature to be usable in production, but the core access control logic (Stories 1-3) can be tested with direct database updates or test fixtures initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as an ADMIN, navigating to user management, and verifying the new roles appear in the role assignment interface and can be assigned/removed from users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an ADMIN user is managing user roles, **When** they view available roles, **Then** they see RISK, REQ, and SECCHAMPION in addition to existing roles (USER, ADMIN, VULN, RELEASE_MANAGER)
2. **Given** an ADMIN user is editing a user's roles, **When** they assign the RISK role to a user, **Then** the assignment is saved and the user's permissions are updated on their next API request
3. **Given** an ADMIN user is editing a user's roles, **When** they assign multiple roles (e.g., REQ + VULN), **Then** the user gets combined permissions from all assigned roles
4. **Given** an ADMIN user removes a role from a user who is currently logged in, **When** the user makes their next API request, **Then** they no longer have access to areas controlled by the removed role

---

### User Story 5 - Navigation Menu Visibility Based on Roles (Priority: P3)

Users should only see navigation menu items they have permission to access, creating a clean and intuitive interface.

**Why this priority**: This is a UX enhancement - users can still be blocked at the API level even if menu items are visible. Important for polish but not for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in with different role combinations and verifying the navigation sidebar shows/hides appropriate menu items based on permissions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with only RISK role is logged in, **When** they view the navigation menu, **Then** they see only Risk Management and non-protected items (not Requirements, not Admin)
2. **Given** a user with only REQ role is logged in, **When** they view the navigation menu, **Then** they see only Requirements and non-protected items (not Risk Management, not Admin)
3. **Given** a user with SECCHAMPION role is logged in, **When** they view the navigation menu, **Then** they see Risk Management, Requirements, and Vulnerabilities but not Admin
4. **Given** a user with no special roles is logged in, **When** they view the navigation menu, **Then** they see only publicly accessible items and items for their assigned roles

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has multiple roles (e.g., RISK + REQ)? → User should have combined permissions from all assigned roles
- What happens when an ADMIN is assigned additional roles (e.g., ADMIN + RISK)? → ADMIN already has all permissions, additional roles have no effect but are allowed
- What happens when a user's role is removed while they are logged in? → User's current page view continues, but the next API request will check updated roles and deny access if permission is removed
- What happens when a user with SECCHAMPION role tries to access an Admin API endpoint directly? → Request is rejected with 403 Forbidden status and logged as an access denial
- What happens when trying to assign a non-existent role? → System validates roles and rejects with an error message
- What happens when documentation (README.md) is out of sync with actual roles? → Documentation should be updated as part of this feature to prevent confusion

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents a user account with one or more assigned roles; roles determine what areas of the application the user can access
- **Role**: Represents a permission level (USER, ADMIN, RISK, REQ, SECCHAMPION, VULN, RELEASE_MANAGER); defines access to specific sections and features
- **Permission Mapping**: Defines which roles grant access to which application sections:
  - Risk Management: ADMIN, RISK, SECCHAMPION
  - Requirements: ADMIN, REQ, SECCHAMPION
  - Vulnerabilities: ADMIN, VULN, SECCHAMPION
  - Admin Area: ADMIN only
  - Workgroups: ADMIN only
  - Releases: ADMIN, RELEASE_MANAGER

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users with RISK role can access all Risk Management features within 5 seconds of login
- **SC-002**: Users with REQ role can access all Requirements features within 5 seconds of login
- **SC-003**: Users with SECCHAMPION role can access Risk Management, Requirements, and Vulnerabilities without any admin access
- **SC-004**: 100% of unauthorized access attempts to protected areas result in clear permission denial messages
- **SC-005**: Role assignment changes take effect on the user's next API request, with no session caching delays
- **SC-006**: Navigation menu displays correctly for each role combination without errors or missing items
- **SC-007**: README.md documentation accurately describes all roles and their permissions with 100% accuracy
- **SC-008**: Admin users can assign/remove new roles to/from users in under 30 seconds
- **SC-009**: System maintains backward compatibility - all existing users with current roles retain their access without disruption
- **SC-010**: Zero instances of users with SECCHAMPION role gaining admin access
- **SC-011**: 100% of access denials are logged with complete audit context (user ID, roles, resource, timestamp) within 1 second of the denial

## Assumptions

1. **Role Assignment**: ADMIN users will use the existing user management interface to assign roles (no separate role management system needed)
2. **Multiple Roles**: Users can be assigned multiple roles and will receive the union of permissions from all roles
3. **Session Management**: Role checks occur on every API request with no caching, ensuring role changes take effect immediately on the next user action without requiring session termination or re-login
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing roles (USER, ADMIN, VULN, RELEASE_MANAGER) and their permissions remain unchanged
5. **Access Control Enforcement**: Both frontend (navigation) and backend (API endpoints) enforce role-based access control
6. **Default Role**: New users without assigned special roles default to USER role with minimal permissions
7. **Admin Override**: ADMIN role retains super-user status with access to all areas regardless of additional role assignments
8. **Error Messages**: Permission denied messages are generic (not revealing required roles or system internals) and direct users to contact their administrator for access requests
9. **Documentation Location**: README.md in the repository root is the primary location for role documentation
10. **Vulnerability Access**: SECCHAMPION role gets same vulnerability access as VULN role (existing permission model)

## Dependencies

- Existing RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) implementation in the application
- User management interface for role assignment
- Navigation menu/sidebar component that can be conditionally rendered based on roles
- API endpoint security annotations or middleware that enforce role requirements
- README.md file in repository root

## Out of Scope

- Creating a new role management UI separate from user management
- Modifying permissions for existing roles (USER, ADMIN, VULN, RELEASE_MANAGER)
- Implementing fine-grained permissions within sections (e.g., read-only vs. edit access)
- Adding role-based data filtering within sections (e.g., user can only see their own risks)
- Multi-tenancy or organization-level role separation
- Role hierarchy or inheritance system
- Audit logging of role changes (may be handled by existing audit system)
- API key or service account role management
