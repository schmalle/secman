# Specification Quality Checklist: Role-Based Access Control - RISK, REQ, and SECCHAMPION Roles

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality ✅
- **No implementation details**: Specification describes WHAT (roles, permissions, access control) not HOW (no mention of specific frameworks, database schemas, or code structure)
- **User-focused**: All requirements written from user perspective (e.g., "users with RISK role can access Risk Management")
- **Stakeholder-friendly**: Uses business language (roles, permissions, access) without technical jargon
- **All sections complete**: User scenarios, requirements, success criteria, assumptions, dependencies all present

### Requirement Completeness ✅
- **No clarifications needed**: All requirements are concrete and actionable without [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- **Testable**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-002: "users with ADMIN or RISK can access Risk Management" - testable by logging in)
- **Measurable success**: All SC items have quantifiable metrics (e.g., SC-001: "within 5 seconds", SC-004: "100% of unauthorized access")
- **Technology-agnostic**: Success criteria describe outcomes not implementations (e.g., "users can access features" not "API returns 200 OK")
- **Complete scenarios**: All user stories have Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios
- **Edge cases covered**: Addressed multi-role users, role removal, direct API access, invalid roles
- **Bounded scope**: Out of Scope section clearly defines what is NOT included
- **Dependencies listed**: RBAC system, user management UI, navigation component, API security, README.md

### Feature Readiness ✅
- **Clear acceptance**: Each functional requirement maps to user stories with acceptance scenarios
- **Primary flows covered**: 5 user stories cover RISK access (P1), REQ access (P1), SECCHAMPION access (P2), role assignment (P2), and navigation (P3)
- **Measurable outcomes**: 10 success criteria define what "done" means
- **No implementation leak**: Specification avoids mentioning specific technologies, staying at the business requirement level

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: EXCELLENT - Ready for `/speckit.plan`

This specification is complete, testable, and ready for implementation planning. All requirements are clear, measurable, and free of technical implementation details. The prioritized user stories provide a clear MVP path (P1 stories for RISK and REQ roles), with well-defined acceptance criteria.

**Recommended Next Step**: Proceed with `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation plan.

**No issues found** - Specification passes all quality checks.
