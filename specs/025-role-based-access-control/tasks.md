# Tasks: Role-Based Access Control - RISK, REQ, and SECCHAMPION Roles

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/025-role-based-access-control/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Following TDD (Test-Driven Development) - NON-NEGOTIABLE constitutional requirement. All tests are written FIRST before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`
- **Checkbox**: ALWAYS `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
- **[ID]**: Sequential task number (T001, T002, ...)
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
- **[Story]**: User story label (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5) - only for user story phases
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions (Web Application)
- **Backend**: `src/backendng/src/main/kotlin/com/secman/`
- **Backend Tests**: `src/backendng/src/test/kotlin/com/secman/`
- **Frontend**: `src/frontend/src/`
- **Frontend Tests**: `src/frontend/tests/e2e/`
- **Documentation**: `README.md` at repository root

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Critical Path (Must Complete in Sequence)

1. **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T001-T004 ‚Üí Database migration and logging infrastructure
2. **Phase 2 (Foundation)**: T005-T020 ‚Üí User entity updates (BLOCKS all user stories)
3. **User Stories (Can run in parallel)**: After Phase 2 complete:
   - Phase 3 (US1): T021-T038
   - Phase 4 (US2): T039-T057
   - Phase 5 (US3): T058-T078
   - Phase 6 (US4): T079-T090
   - Phase 7 (US5): T091-T100
4. **Phase 8 (Polish)**: T101-T112 ‚Üí After all user stories complete

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**After Phase 2 Foundation Complete, these can run in parallel:**

- **Team A**: User Story 1 (RISK role) - Tasks T021-T038
- **Team B**: User Story 2 (REQ role) - Tasks T039-T057
- **Team C**: User Story 3 (SECCHAMPION role) - Tasks T058-T078
- **Team D**: User Story 4 (Role assignment) - Tasks T079-T090
- **Team E**: User Story 5 (Navigation) - Tasks T091-T100

**Within each user story, these tasks can run in parallel:**
- Test writing tasks (all [P] marked tests)
- Implementation tasks for different files ([P] marked implementations)

**Example: User Story 1 Parallel Execution**
- Tests T021-T030 (10 tasks) can all be written in parallel by different developers
- Implementations T031, T032, T033, T037 can run in parallel (different files)
- T034-T036 must run sequentially (same file - Sidebar.tsx)

---

## Independent Test Criteria by User Story

### User Story 1 (RISK Role)
**Test**: Create test user with ONLY RISK role ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Access /api/risk-assessments (200 OK) ‚Üí Access /api/requirements (403 Forbidden with generic message) ‚Üí Verify access denial logged

### User Story 2 (REQ Role)
**Test**: Create test user with ONLY REQ role ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Access /api/requirements (200 OK) ‚Üí Access /api/risk-assessments (403 Forbidden with generic message) ‚Üí Verify access denial logged

### User Story 3 (SECCHAMPION Role)
**Test**: Create test user with ONLY SECCHAMPION role ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Access /api/risk-assessments, /api/requirements, /api/vulnerabilities (all 200 OK) ‚Üí Access /api/admin (403 Forbidden) ‚Üí Verify access denial logged

### User Story 4 (Role Assignment)
**Test**: Login as ADMIN ‚Üí Assign RISK role to test user ‚Üí Verify user can access /api/risk-assessments on next request (within 30 seconds) ‚Üí Remove RISK role ‚Üí Verify user loses access on next request

### User Story 5 (Navigation)
**Test**: Login with each role ‚Üí Verify navigation items match permission matrix ‚Üí Login with multi-role user (RISK + REQ) ‚Üí Verify both sections visible

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (Minimum Viable Product)
- **Phase 1**: Setup (T001-T004)
- **Phase 2**: Foundation (T005-T020)
- **Phase 3**: User Story 1 - RISK role (T021-T038)
- **Phase 4**: User Story 2 - REQ role (T039-T057)

**MVP Deliverable**: RISK and REQ roles fully functional with access control, audit logging, and frontend navigation

### Full Feature Scope
- **MVP** + Phase 5 (SECCHAMPION), Phase 6 (Role Assignment UI), Phase 7 (Navigation Polish), Phase 8 (Documentation)

### Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 30 minutes (4 tasks)
- **Phase 2**: 90 minutes (16 tasks - TDD foundation)
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: 120 minutes (18 tasks - backend + frontend + E2E)
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: 120 minutes (19 tasks - similar to US1)
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: 120 minutes (21 tasks - broader permissions)
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: 60 minutes (12 tasks - role assignment)
- **Phase 7 (US5)**: 45 minutes (10 tasks - navigation polish)
- **Phase 8**: 90 minutes (12 tasks - documentation + validation)

**Total**: ~11 hours (MVP: ~6 hours for US1 + US2)

---

## Format Validation ‚úÖ

**All tasks follow required format**:
- ‚úÖ Checkbox prefix `- [ ]`
- ‚úÖ Sequential Task IDs (T001-T112)
- ‚úÖ [P] marker for parallelizable tasks
- ‚úÖ [Story] label for user story tasks (US1-US5)
- ‚úÖ File paths in descriptions
- ‚úÖ Clear action verbs

**Total Tasks**: 112
- Setup: 4 tasks
- Foundation: 16 tasks (TDD tests + implementation)
- User Story 1: 18 tasks (10 tests + 8 implementations)
- User Story 2: 19 tasks (10 tests + 9 implementations)
- User Story 3: 21 tasks (11 tests + 10 implementations)
- User Story 4: 12 tasks (9 tests + 3 implementations)
- User Story 5: 10 tasks (8 tests + 2 implementations)
- Polish: 12 tasks

**TDD Compliance**: 58 tests written FIRST before 54 implementation tasks ‚úÖ

---

**Next**: Begin Phase 1 (Setup) ‚Üí Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle throughout
