# Standard View Structure Update

## Changes Made

I've successfully added the structure information to the Standard View page with the following features:

### 1. **Accordion-based Chapter Display**
- Implemented a collapsible accordion interface for displaying standard chapters
- First chapter is expanded by default, others are collapsed
- Clean, organized presentation of hierarchical information

### 2. **Sample Structure Data**
The view now displays a comprehensive standard structure with:
- **6 Main Chapters:**
  1. Introduction and Scope
  2. General Requirements
  3. Technical Requirements
  4. Implementation and Operation
  5. Performance Evaluation
  6. Improvement

### 3. **Requirements within Chapters**
Each chapter contains:
- Numbered requirements (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, etc.)
- Requirement titles
- Brief descriptions
- View buttons for future detailed requirement viewing

### 4. **Visual Design**
- Clean Bootstrap accordion styling
- Chapter numbers and titles in bold
- Requirements displayed as list items with:
  - Blue requirement numbers
  - Clear titles and descriptions
  - Eye icon buttons for viewing details

### 5. **Interactive Features**
- Click chapter headers to expand/collapse
- Smooth accordion transitions
- View buttons on each requirement (ready for future implementation)

## How It Works

1. Navigate to `/standards`
2. Click the "View" button on any standard
3. The Standard Details page shows:
   - Basic Information (name, description, dates)
   - Associated Use Cases
   - **NEW: Standard Structure with chapters and requirements**

## Note on Implementation

Currently, this is using sample data to demonstrate the structure functionality. In a production implementation, you would need to:

1. Create backend relationships between Standards and Requirements
2. Add a `chapters` or `structure` endpoint to the Standard API
3. Update the ViewStandard component to fetch real data from the backend

The frontend infrastructure is now ready to display real standard structures once the backend provides the data.
