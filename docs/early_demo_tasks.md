# Top 10 Tasks for Early Demo Release

This document outlines the 10 most critical tasks to complete before releasing Secman as an early demo. These tasks focus on essential functionality, basic security, and necessary documentation to ensure a successful demonstration.

## Priority Tasks

1. [ ]  **Complete the README.md**: Remove draft markers and fill in placeholder sections to provide clear information about what Secman does and its basic features.
2. [ ]  **Improve Installation Documentation**: Update INSTALL.md with clear, step-by-step instructions that work reliably across environments, ensuring demo users can successfully set up the application.

3. **Create a Quick Start Guide**: Develop a simple guide with screenshots showing how to perform basic operations (creating requirements, performing risk assessments) for demo users.

5. [ ]  **Fix Database Setup Script**: Ensure the database installation script (install.sh) works correctly and provides clear feedback, as this is critical for first-time setup.

6. **Create a Demo Data Script**: Develop a script to populate the database with realistic sample data, allowing users to immediately see the application's capabilities.

8. [ ]  **Test and Fix Critical User Flows**: Ensure that the core user journeys (login, creating/editing requirements, risk assessment) work without errors.
9. [ ]  **Optimize Frontend for Demo**: Make basic UI improvements to ensure the application looks professional enough for demonstration purposes.
10. [ ]  **Set Up Basic Error Handling**: Implement user-friendly error messages for common issues to improve the demo experience when things go wrong.

## Implementation Notes

- These tasks are specifically selected for an early demo release and do not represent all improvements needed for a production release.
- Focus on making the demo functional and presentable rather than feature-complete or production-ready.
- After completing these tasks, collect feedback from early demo users to inform the next phase of development.
