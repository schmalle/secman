30. [ ]  Set up continuous integration to run all tests automatically

## Security

31. [ ]  Implement proper password management with configurable password policies
32. [ ]  Replace hardcoded credentials (e.g., "CHANGEME" password) with secure configuration
33. [ ]  Implement proper CSRF protection
34. [ ]  Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
35. [ ]  Implement audit logging for security-sensitive operations
36. [ ]  Conduct a security review of dependencies and update vulnerable packages
37. [ ]  Implement proper input validation across all user inputs
38. [ ]  Set up security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
39. [ ]  Implement secure file upload handling with proper validation and scanning
40. [ ]  Create a security testing plan including penetration testing

## Performance

41. [ ]  Implement caching for frequently accessed data
42. [ ]  Optimize frontend bundle size with code splitting and lazy loading
43. [ ]  Implement database query optimization and indexing
44. [ ]  Add performance monitoring and metrics collection
45. [ ]  Optimize image and asset loading in the frontend
46. [ ]  Implement pagination for large data sets
47. [ ]  Add server-side rendering or static generation for critical pages
48. [ ]  Optimize API response times for critical endpoints
49. [ ]  Implement database connection pooling
50. [ ]  Set up load testing to identify performance bottlenecks

## Developer Experience

51. [ ]  Set up a consistent code formatting tool (e.g., Prettier, Scalafmt)
52. [ ]  Implement linting rules for both frontend and backend
53. [ ]  Create a streamlined local development environment setup script
54. [ ]  Improve the git hooks workflow for pre-commit and pre-push checks
