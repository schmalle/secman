# Asset and Risk Assessment Models - IMPLEMENTED

## Completed Implementation

### Asset Model
✅ **Entity: `Asset`**
- `id`: Long, primary key, auto-generated
- `name`: String, required, max 255 characters, must not be blank
- `type`: String, required, must not be blank (Server, Workstation, Network Device, etc.)
- `ip`: String, nullable (for IP addresses)
- `owner`: String, required, max 255 characters (person or team responsible for the asset)
- `createdAt`: LocalDateTime, set automatically on creation, not updatable
- `updatedAt`: LocalDateTime, set automatically on update

### Risk Assessment Model
✅ **Entity: `RiskAssessment`**
- `id`: Long, primary key, auto-generated
- `asset`: Many-to-One relationship with Asset entity
- `startDate`: LocalDate, required (start date of risk assessment)
- `endDate`: LocalDate, required (end date of risk assessment)
- `status`: String, default "PENDING" (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
- `assessor`: String, nullable (name of person conducting the assessment)
- `notes`: String, nullable, max 1024 characters
- `createdAt`: LocalDateTime, set automatically on creation
- `updatedAt`: LocalDateTime, set automatically on update

### Database Evolution Scripts
✅ **Created evolution scripts:**
- `5.sql`: Asset table creation
- `6.sql`: Risk Assessment table creation with foreign key to Asset

### Backend Controllers
✅ **AssetController.java**: Full CRUD operations for Asset management
✅ **RiskAssessmentController.java**: Full CRUD operations for Risk Assessment management
- Includes special endpoint to get assessments by asset ID

### API Routes
✅ **Added routes in conf/routes:**
- Asset Management: `/api/assets/*`
- Risk Assessment Management: `/api/risk-assessments/*`
- Special endpoint: `/api/risk-assessments/asset/:assetId`

### Frontend Components
✅ **AssetManagement.tsx**: React component for asset management
- Inline form for creating/editing assets
- Asset type dropdown with predefined options
- IP address validation
- Bootstrap styling consistent with existing components

✅ **RiskAssessmentManagement.tsx**: React component for risk assessment management
- Asset selection dropdown
- Date pickers for start/end dates
- Status management with color-coded badges
- Notes and assessor fields

### Frontend Pages
✅ **Created Astro pages:**
- `/pages/assets.astro`: Asset management page
- `/pages/risk-assessments.astro`: Risk assessment management page
- Both include "Back to Home" buttons

### Navigation Updates
✅ **Updated Sidebar.astro:**
- Added "Asset Management" with server icon
- Added "Risk Assessment" with clipboard-check icon

### Key Features Implemented
- **Asset Types**: Server, Workstation, Network Device, Mobile Device, IoT Device, Database, Application, Other
- **Assessment Status**: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED with color-coded badges
- **Asset-based Risk Assessment**: Every risk assessment is tied to a specific asset
- **Date Validation**: Ensures proper start and end date handling
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap-based responsive interface
- **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for both entities

### Notes
- All models use JPA/Hibernate annotations for database mapping
- Bean Validation annotations ensure data integrity
- Lifecycle methods automatically manage timestamps
- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity between Risk Assessments and Assets
- Components follow the existing UI patterns established in the application
