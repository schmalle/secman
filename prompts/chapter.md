# Format of the Microsoft Word Document for Requirements Export

This document outlines the desired structure and content for the exported Microsoft Word (`.docx`) file containing all requirements. The format emphasizes readability and a clear, chapter-based organization.

## Document Structure

The Word document should be structured as follows:

1.  **Title Page / Header Information**
    *   **Main Title:** "Requirements Export"
    *   **Subtitle:** "Generated on: [Date]" (e.g., "Generated on: 2025-06-01")
    *   *(A blank paragraph for spacing can be included after the subtitle)*

2.  **Table of Contents**
    *   A dynamically generated Table of Contents (ToC).
    *   The ToC should list all main chapters (derived from the 'Norm' field) as top-level entries.
    *   Optionally, individual Requirement IDs/Short Requirements can be listed as sub-entries under each chapter in the ToC for more detailed navigation.
    *   Each entry in the ToC should link to the corresponding chapter or requirement in the document.
    *   *Note: Implementation will require backend logic to structure the document with appropriate heading styles for ToC generation (e.g., using Apache POI).*

3.  **Requirements by Chapter**
    *   This section will form the main body of the document.
    *   Requirements are to be grouped by chapter. The chapter designation should be derived from the `Requirement.norm` field (e.g., the part before the first space, or a more sophisticated parsing if applicable).

    *   **For each Chapter:**
        *   **Chapter Heading:** Display the chapter name prominently (e.g., `## Chapter 1: [Chapter Name derived from Norm]`).
        *   **Introduction (Optional):** A brief introductory sentence for the chapter, if applicable.

        *   **For each Requirement within the Chapter:**
            *   **Requirement Sub-Heading:** `### Requirement [Requirement.id]: [Requirement.shortreq]`
            *   **Norm Reference:**
                *   `**Norm:** [Requirement.norm]` (Full norm reference)
            *   **Details:**
                *   `[Requirement.details]` (Formatted as a paragraph or multiple paragraphs if long)
            *   **Motivation (Optional, if present):**
                *   `**Motivation:** [Requirement.motivation]`
            *   **Example (Optional, if present):**
                *   `**Example:** [Requirement.example]`
            *   A horizontal rule (`---`) or distinct spacing should separate individual requirements within a chapter for clarity.

## Formatting Notes

*   **Headings:** Use standard Word heading styles (Heading 1 for Main Title, Heading 2 for Chapters, Heading 3 for Requirements) to ensure proper ToC generation and document structure.
*   **Font:** Use a clean, readable font (e.g., Calibri, Arial) at a standard size (e.g., 11pt or 12pt for body text).
*   **Consistency:** Maintain consistent formatting for all elements (headings, body text, lists) throughout the document.

This format aims to produce a professional, easily navigable document suitable for review and reference.
