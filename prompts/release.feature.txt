Preconditions:

Requirements are existing.
Initial release definition and implementation is existing
Every requirement has a unique ID.
Every requirement can have different versions stored in secman.
A release describes a defined state of requirements at a given time.

Examples for Releases:

Release 1.0

Requirement 1 Version 1
Requirement 2 Version 1
Requirement 3 Version 3

Release 2.0

Requirement 1 Version 2
Requirement 2 Version 1
Requirement 3 Version 4


**Updated concept:

A release can have the following states

ACTIVE = Current active release
ARCHIVED = Oudated Release, saved
PREPARATION = if a new release is created it is always in mode PREPARATION
ALIGNMENT = Requirements have been updated where necessary and alignment has started

Per default secman starts always with the active release.

If the user switches from e.g. from the active release 1 to the release 2 (which is preparation) and
i want to export requirements, i would get an export with

Requirement 1 Version 2
Requirement 2 Version 1
Requirement 3 Version 4

switching back to release 1, i would see

Requirement 1 Version 1
Requirement 2 Version 1
Requirement 3 Version 3


**Deliverables


Switch logic for release and UI elements
Added / validated export logic
Full end2end test suite for releases, assuming SECMAN_USERNAME,SECMAN_PASSWORD, SECMAN_API_KEY are set
as environment variables.
